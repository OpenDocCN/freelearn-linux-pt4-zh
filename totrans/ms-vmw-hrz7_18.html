<p><span>As you must be aware by now</span>, a successful VDI, or end-user computing project, is made up of multiple components, and its success comes down to delivering a good user experience. It's not just about whether the infrastructure is working or not. As such, it is important to have a well-defined methodology, and the tools to be able to adequately diagnose and fix issues within your environment. In this chapter, we are going to cover some of the troubleshooting techniques, and other methods for monitoring the end user experience within Horizon View.</p>
<p>Essentially, we are going to look at troubleshooting from two angles, reactive and proactive, covering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>General troubleshooting tips</li>
<li>Troubleshooting Horizon View issues</li>
<li>vRealize Operations for Horizon</li>
<li>Liquidware Stratusphere UX</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also going to use Liquidware Stratusphere UX to highlight some of the key elements to look at when troubleshooting and monitoring your environment.</p>

<p>In the first section of this chapter, we are going to briefly look at some general troubleshooting tips. We will start with looking at what the end users are reporting as issues. Is it down to a particular app or desktop configuration? If it is a performance-related issue, we need to be able to correlate that back to the supporting infrastructure components, such as which server their desktop or apps are running on, so that we can isolate host resource issues, such as a slow network or slow disk.</p>

<p><span><span>Quite often, when there are issues,</span></span> it is the VDI solution that automatically gets the blame. This is because it is a new deployment, and end user perception is that, because the desktop is running remotely, then it is to blame. You need to remember that the Horizon View technology is just one component in the overall infrastructure, along with the desktop that the user is utilizing. Just because the desktop is sitting within a VDI environment doesn't always mean it's a View issue. It could well be a desktop, network, or application issue, which would have occurred in a physical environment too.</p>
<p>When a user reports an issue, or you notice an issue within the infrastructure, you will need to think logically as to which component within the infrastructure is going to be the likely cause, and where you are going to start your troubleshooting journey. Maybe it is a storage issue, or even a Windows issue, and it has got nothing to do with VDI at all!</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Is the issue affecting more than one user?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A good place to start examining any issues within your environment is by finding the answers to the following questions: who is experiencing the issue? Has more than one user reported the same issue? If you try and recreate the issue, do you get the same results? Can another user, with the same permissions and the same resources, recreate the issue?</p>
<p>If you find that the issue is really only related to a single user, then consider <span><span>what the issue is that they</span></span> are experiencing. For example, you can ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What device are they connecting from?</li>
<li>What connection protocol are they connecting over, and have they tried a different protocol?</li>
<li>Could it be a bandwidth or connection reliability issue?</li>
<li>Could a port be blocked?</li>
<li>Do they have specific application or permission requirements?</li>
<li>Are they entitled the correct pools?</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If you believe that the issue has something to do with their desktop, then maybe consider refreshing it. This is the beauty of VDI; you could simply rebuild a new desktop, and not spend hours trying to troubleshoot and fix application or OS issues if a simple refresh could resolve it.</p>
<p>If the issue is affecting more than one user, check whether a fix could be applied to the base image, and then be rolled out to your desktop pools to simplify the process of resolving the issue.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>This is probably one of the widest subject areas to look at when troubleshooting your View environment. Performance issues could relate to so many areas, aspects, and also (in some cases) be based on a personal opinion.</span></p>

<p>If your users are reporting poor performance, then ask them to try and be more specific, rather than them just saying "it's slow". Is it taking a long time to log in, or is it an application that is taking longer than expected to load? Keep a log of the issue, along with the time and date that the issue occurred, or if it's an ongoing issue.</p>
<p>Ask the users the following when the issue occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are they measuring the performance?</li>
<li>What time of the day do they experience the problem?</li>
<li>Are they doing something specific when they experience the problem?</li>
<li>Are they connecting from somewhere specific, or from a specific device, when they have the issue?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever possible, try to visit the end user and understand their issue first-hand. This will enable you to the get to the bottom of the issue with ease. Hopefully, as we discussed in <a href="20877fa6-9a03-4c97-ab85-4a4338e2c680.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Design and Deployment Considerations</em>, you will have engaged the end users early, and they will be positive and on board with the overall solution and willing to help.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Using Liquidware Stratusphere, you could also look at the baseline for when this user was on-boarded, and then look at the trend information. This will help you identify any changes to the environment, and you would also know what else was happening at the time they experienced the issue. An example of this is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Performance issues on a desktop can be caused by many factors, regardless of whether they are virtual or physical desktops. Common areas for consideration include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended login times</li>
<li>Application crashes</li>
<li>Long application load times</li>
<li>OS crashes</li>
<li>Poor application performance</li>
<li>Permission errors</li>
</ul>

<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p>As we just mentioned, many of these issues can, and will, occur whether the desktop is virtualized or not, but, in the virtualized environment, any type of issues that arise will be easier to resolve. For example, if you find you are getting OS or application crashes, consider patching these elements to the latest updates and recomposing the image for all users. This could take a lot longer, and be a lot more difficult, with a physical desktop estate.</p>
<p>Maybe login times or application load times are suffering due to a CPU performance issue. The following screenshot shows the output of the login monitoring feature of Liquidware Stratusphere:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f07e23ba-5c08-46e7-8cac-fe53f9f525c2.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span>Monitoring feature of Liquidware Stratusphere</span></div>
<p>With each individual virtual desktop machine, you can drill down into each process and service running on it, allowing you to see things such as how long the process took to load, as well as any other dependencies that process has. This is invaluable information when troubleshooting login issues, and particularity when migrating from physical desktops to virtual desktops and identifying services that should not be used in virtual environments, yet still exist and cause issues in virtual desktops.</p>
<p>With physical desktops, you would be stuck with the hardware unless you replace or upgrade the constrained components, but in a VDI environment you can consider tweaking the spec at a push of a button, as long as you have the underlying resources.</p>
<p>The important point to understand is that generic desktop issues will still exist regardless, <span>and so, it is recommended to use the VDI</span> platform to your advantage to help resolve these. We have worked with so many organizations that have deployed VDI and have it running in production, and once the solution is implemented they tend to forget about generic desktop support and spend far too much time digging deep into the VDI architecture infrastructure looking for faults, when the answer maybe a simple Windows OS or application issue.</p>

<p>Any networking-related issues can often be the most difficult to get to the bottom of. Wherever possible, ensure that you work closely with your networking team to ensure there is suitable end-to-end monitoring in place.</p>
<p>While your users are connecting on a LAN, you would hope there would be plentiful bandwidth, latency would be low enough, and therefore connectivity would be reliable. If you are struggling on a LAN, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has anything on the network changed?</li>
<li>Is the user connecting via a wired or wireless network?</li>
<li>Have you configured PCoIP for QoS on your switches?</li>
<li>Is the network currently reliable?</li>
<li>Are you seeing any dropped packets between any of the following?
<ul>
<li>Clients to the core switching</li>
<li>Clients to servers</li>
<li>Clients to VDI desktops</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is the latency as expected?</li>
<li>Even on the LAN in larger environments, bandwidth could be an issue—have you considered the sum of the bandwidth required from your client devices to VDI desktops?</li>
<li>Are you routing between networks? Do the routers work at a suitable level of performance?</li>
<li>Are the load balancers sized correctly for your environment?</li>
</ul>
<p>When your users are connecting over a WAN, it can sometimes be more difficult to troubleshoot or guarantee connection quality.</p>
<p>For remote or branch offices, ensure that the internet connection is suitably sized; wherever possible, ensure that you have configured QoS for the PCoIP protocol from end to end, and ensure that you have suitably configured the PCoIP policy to cope with the reduced bandwidth.</p>
<p>When troubleshooting issues, investigate the relevant logs on the client and on the View Connection Servers, as well as any intermediary components, such as the load balancers and routers.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following list contains some of the more common faults that a user will report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black screens</strong>: This is commonly caused by ports blocking the PCoIP Protocol somewhere in the chain. Check that the PCoIP port are open; namely, port <kbd>4172</kbd>.</li>
<li><strong>Disconnections</strong>: High latency and dropped packets will cause the users to be disconnected from their desktops. Ensure that you allow enough time for users to reconnect before refreshing desktops.</li>
<li><strong>Poor resolution images</strong>: Due to the nature of the protocol if there is low bandwidth, users may complain about low-quality images. Consider limiting the image build options in the user policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot shows an example of information for the PCoIP protocol recorded by Liquidware Stratusphere UX:</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>CPU and memory issues on your host servers can adversely affect the end user experience. As with most technical solutions, we recommend that, while you are going through your initial testing and rolling out, you document your baseline for key performance characteristics, such as CPU and memory utilization, and deeper metrics such as CPU-ready times.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>With this baseline information in your toolkit, it is easier to compare the performance before the issue occurred to what you are seeing now. This will help to try and pinpoint what could be causing the problem. Likewise, using technology such as vRealize Operations for Horizon will help you understand performance utilization over time. You could use a third-party product such as Liquidware Stratusphere. Stratusphere provides the baseline metrics (measured during the assessment phase), as well as the current user experience, allowing you to quickly identify what changed, and what is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Within your VDI infrastructure, you don't want to be experiencing any memory</span> overcommits. Y<span>ou need to consider how much memory is allocated to your virtual desktops, as well as the total memory within your hosts. Ideally, you want to ensure that your total allocated memory is less than the total in your host servers. Don't forget that should one of the host servers fail, you will still need to supply the required memory resource.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>If you are experiencing performance issues related to memory or CPU, check whether memory is being swapped by any of the virtual desktop machines. Check whether there is any ballooning within the environment. Understand what your CPU-ready characteristics are. The acceptable CPU-ready figures within your VDI environment will vary based on the environment and users. Generally speaking, you are going to want to keep CPU-ready below 5% per allocated CPU, with 10% at peak. Anything over these numbers would indicate that the host server is being overloaded, and will impact the performance of the CPU and lead to slow performance of the virtual desktop machines. The following screenshot shows an example of CPU monitoring and, in particular, the CPU-ready time:</span></p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span>CPU monitoring and CPU-ready time</span></div>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>It can be very easy when growing your VDI solution from the initial design to forget to sanity-check these metrics and keep an eye on them as you grow, and, all of a sudden, you may find you have a compute performance issue.</span></p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>As we have previously mentioned, the disk solution deployed is a key component for a successful VDI deployment. You need to be able to keep an eye on the disk performance, which is key to avoiding issues in the future.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>How much latency is acceptable within your environment is going to very much depend on the users. Also consider what will happen as you scale up the solution. While we may say that disk latency of less than 25 ms is generally acceptable, it doesn't mean that a user who has been using a desktop with sub-25 ms latency would even notice if, all of a sudden, they were experiencing 25 ms latency or more.</span></p>
<p>Your storage vendor will likely have their own toolset to manage and monitor the performance; however, the following screenshot shows an overview of storage IOPS performance on a per-host basis:</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>There are a number of components that we have discussed throughout this book that make up your Horizon View infrastructure, and while they are generally very reliable, they can of course fail at some point, with serious knock-on effects. Wherever possible, you should be ensuring that your Horizon environment is highly available, and where this may not be possible, then ensure that the components are sufficiently monitored using components such as vRealize Operations for Horizon, or, as we have used in the example lab, a third-party monitoring solution such as Liquidware Stratusphere.</span></p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>The first port of call when troubleshooting your Horizon View infrastructure should be the event log within the Horizon View Administrator console. You can quickly and easily access the event log by clicking alerts in the top left-hand corner of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bf714913-ecd0-4168-8d16-85d8b63e8f9f.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span>Event log within the Horizon View Administrator console</span></div>
<p>You should also utilize the dashboard view in the View Administrator to get a quick overview to understand the health of your environment. This screen will show you the health of all the key components within your infrastructure, such as vCenter, Hosts, View Connection Servers, View Security Servers, Desktops, RDS Hosts and Datastores.</p>
<p>This is a great resource to start troubleshooting infrastructure issues within your Horizon View environment.</p>
<p>You should also not forget the simplest of troubleshooting steps when experiencing issues with your Horizon View Infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are all the servers, desktops, hosts, and so on, contactable on the network?</li>
<li>Are all the required services started?</li>
<li>Is there sufficient free space on all servers?</li>
<li>Is the memory and CPU maxed out?</li>
<li>Have you checked all the events logs?</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Consideration also needs to be given to the backend database systems, and the effect that would be felt if they were to go offline. Ensure your SQL solution is reliant and the same as all other components. If you are having issues with maybe your vCenter or View Composer, ensure you check the SQL Server for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there sufficient resources?</li>
<li>Are the services started?</li>
<li>Are the correct ports open?</li>
<li>Is there enough free disk space for the database and logs?</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there may be issues that arise that are outside those that we have discussed so far. Horizon View has its own integrated system health monitoring and, as such, reports errors relating to Horizon View-specific issues, allowing administrators to quickly pinpoint issues easily. Unfortunately, sometimes the corrective actions can be quite cumbersome and manual to implement.</p>
<p>Issues you may see that require specific corrective actions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual removal of a View Connection Server or Security Server after loss of a component or OS corruptions</li>
<li>Manual removal of VDI desktops or whole pools</li>
<li>Recovery of Horizon View from a backup</li>
<li>Recovery of a persistent disk from a backup</li>
<li>Persistent disks running out of space for users</li>
</ul>
<p>We aren't going to cover all the specific corrective actions for all of these processes here, as we could write an entire book to do them justice, but there are some great <strong>knowledge-base</strong> (<strong>KB</strong>) articles already available on VMware's KB site at <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/">http://kb.vmware.com</a>.</p>
<p>One issue that we will cover briefly, and one that does come up fairly often, is with the View Composer database, and inconsistencies in the database that lead to provisioning errors. VMware has a tool to address database errors called the <strong>ViewDBChk</strong> tool, which we will cover in the next section.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>A provisioning error can occur when there are inconsistencies between the LDAP, vCenter Server, and View Composer databases, and are often caused by editing virtual desktop machines directly in the vCenter Server inventory, or restoring a virtual desktop machine from a backup.</p>
<p>The ViewDBChk tool allows View administrators to scan for machines that cannot be provisioned, and also allows you to remove invalid database entries. This then allows the Connection Server to be able to re-provision desktops without any errors.</p>
<p>You will find this in the <kbd>View</kbd> folder that gets created at install time. The folder can be found by navigating to the following path:</p>
<pre><strong>C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware View\Server\Tools\bin</strong></pre>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>The tool is command-line-driven, and has a number of parameters for each of the functions you can perform. These are listed in the following table:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/be8ced29-a3d2-4064-ba7a-ab576d709c42.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Table showing <span>parameters for each of the functions</span></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>For example, to run the command to remove a machine from a desktop pool, at the command prompt, type the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>ViewDbChk --removeMachine --desktopName</strong></pre>
<p>In the next section, we are going to look at some of the additional tools available for monitoring and managing the environment.</p>

<p>vRealize Operations for Horizon is available as part of Horizon Enterprise or as a separate product. Where vRealize Operations differs from most monitoring tools is in its analytics engine. Most monitoring tools are based around setting thresholds for key values, such as CPU, or memory consumed. The issue with these kinds of alarms is that simply stumbling over a threshold value doesn't mean there is necessarily an issue. Sometimes, it is within the normal parameters of the applications in use, or potentially, the problem could be one of the resources not being consumed when it should be.</p>
<p>With the analytics engine included within vRealize Operations, it is able to learn and understand what the normal working parameters of your environment are. From this, it is then able to alert you when an error occurs that falls outside these parameters. It is also able to track growth and consumption over time to preempt an issue prior to it occurring.</p>
<p>vRealize Operations for Horizon should be installed, where possible, at the beginning of your project. vRealize Operations is deployed simply via a single virtual appliance, or vApp, and when deployed and configured, it starts listening and learning about your environment.</p>
<p>There are three key metrics tracked with vRealize Operations, which are health, risk, and efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health reports on the current health status of your environment. Items that could affect health are high packet loss, component failure, and disk capacity at a critical level, among others.</li>
<li>Risk indicates an issue within your environment that, if left unattended, could very well become an issue to the health of your environment.</li>
<li>Efficiency reports on considerations, such as overprovisioning, which, if rectified, could help you get more out of your environment to maximize the investment. An example of this is VMs with overprovisioned CPU or memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot shows an end user experience dashboard, highlighting CPU usage:</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>vRealize Operations for Horizon also includes specific features to ensure you fully understand the health of your Horizon View environment, including the full visibility of the PCoIP protocol as well as integration for health monitoring with the View Connection Server, View Security, and more.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>The analytics engine of vRealize Operations will learn your environment and understand what is normal, raising alarms based on dynamic thresholds for your environment rather than meaningless static thresholds.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Within vRealize Operations, it also incorporates a smart alerts feature that allows you to quickly understand the root cause of an issue within your infrastructure, and the recommended remediation actions to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>There are also a number of third-party tools and solutions that go beyond the monitoring of the environment. One of those tools is Liquidware's Stratusphere solution, which we will discuss in the next section.</p>

<p>Liquidware Stratusphere UX is more than just a monitoring tool. In fact, it is more of a user life cycle management tool, and has played a part throughout the deployment we have covered throughout this book. We first used the output from Stratusphere UX when we assessed our current environment to provide us with an overview of the resources being used, but also to give us a baseline to work from as we deployed Horizon.</p>
<p>We then used this baseline to assist in tuning the end user experience as we <span>on-boarded</span> <span>users and built our gold images to ensure that the end users were running at their most optimal levels of performance.</span></p>
<p>Finally, Stratusphere can be used as a diagnostic tool to aid the IT support team to get to the root cause of an issue quickly. IT can quickly understand where the issue lies, <span>providing a detailed analysis of a single user, single machine, or single application, allowing an end-to-end view of a user's virtual desktop session, where it's hosted, and what resources it's consuming, helping to identify issues quickly.</span></p>
<p>As you will have seen in the previous sections and the screenshots, Liquidware Stratusphere can easily help monitor and manage your environment.</p>

<p>There are a number of resources available if you are struggling to get to the bottom of an issue with Horizon View. First and foremost, we recommend logging a call as early as possible with VMware Support to get the best assistance possible to resolve your issue. You could also try the various blogs and posts from the VMware EUC community.</p>
<p>There is also the VMware Community, which has a wealth of resources available at <a href="https://communities.vmware.com">https://communities.vmware.com.</a></p>

<p>Finally, and possibly the most useful resource, is the VMware Knowledge Base, as we mentioned previously in this chapter. At the time of writing this, there are 300 specific support topics related to Horizon View, including video how-to guides alongside step-by-step resolution guides.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have covered some of the methods and areas to consider when troubleshooting issues within your Horizon View environment. Consideration should be given to the bigger picture, ensuring you fully understand the issues the user is facing, and which area of the user's desktop experience could be causing these issues. Where possible, use monitoring tools such as vRealize Operations for Horizon to find the root cause of the problem. There are a number of areas within Horizon View you should check if you believe you have infrastructure problems. These include the dashboard and the event log within the Horizon View Administrator.</p>
<p>Finally, we covered getting further help from the VMware Knowledge Base.</p>
<p>We have now reached the end of this book, and by reaching this point, you should now have a greater understanding of the architecture of the Horizon Suite and how to design your end user computing solution. You should also understand the stages and details involved with rolling out Horizon View for your users, including installing the various components, and configuring, designing, and building the desktop images and pools. You will have learned about the various methods to layer your applications to your desktops, using technology such as ThinApp, RDSH-published applications, and App Layers.</p>
<p>Designing and rolling out any end user computing solution to any organization is a task that must be undertaken with care and understanding for the users, and we hope the topics that we have covered within this book will better equip you for your tasks ahead.</p>
