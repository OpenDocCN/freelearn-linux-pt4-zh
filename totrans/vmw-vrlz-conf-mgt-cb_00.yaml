- en: VMware is the pioneer and leader in SDDC with its various tools; VCM is responsible
    for policy-driven compliance management and the patching of infrastructure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: VCM helps in maintaining the compliance of infrastructure by automatically collecting
    data and analyzing it against industry standards such as VMware and Microsoft
    Hardening Guidelines, CIS Benchmarks, PCI DSS, and FISMA, to name a few. It helps
    you patch your machines with the latest patches released by OS vendors and automate
    software provisioning. You can see your compliance score on the vROps console
    after integrating both of them.

- en: This book provides recipes for installing VCM and then the initial configuration,
    moving ahead with integration to another VMware tool. After this, it continues
    with configuring compliance and patching for Linux and Windows machines. We have
    a chapter that will help you configure VCM in order to deploy software from VCM.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are planning to go along with your practices as per the recipes in the
    book, which is highly recommended, you will need a good lab  to work in. As VCM
    works with multiple VMware components, and you will want to test integration as
    well, then you will need a machine with at least 32 GB of RAM, supported by a
    minimum of a quad-core processor, 1 TB HDD, and 256 GB SSD. You can install your
    favorite OS and on top of it either VMware Workstation or Virtual box. You need
    to create a small lab that will include a Windows Domain controller, and a few
    Windows servers hosting SQL, vCenter, VCM, and so on. You can install other components
    such as vCloud Director, vROps, and vCNS. Sometimes, 32 GB of RAM may not be sufficient,
    so power on only those VMs that you will need. Basic functionalities can be tested
    with a portable lab on your laptop with 16 GB RAM, which excludes vCD, vROps,
    and VCNS.
