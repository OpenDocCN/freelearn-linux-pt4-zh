    mostly peer-to-peer topologies. It's relatively inexpensive, readily available,

    (**TP**) wiring is an **electro-magnetic interference** (**EMI**) sponge. Back
    in the late 1880s, the telephone people discovered that wrapping or twisting two
    wire strands together helped to reduce the amount of noise the wires absorbed
    from outside the cable. However, twisting wire pairs only reduces how susceptible
    TP is to electrical noise.

    of the same type. A patch cable is a generic term or any cable type used to connect
    two devices. A rollover cable has reversed pinouts and creates an interface between
    two dissimilar devices. Straight-through cables have the same pinout standard
    on their ends and connect a network adapter to a device, such as a router.
