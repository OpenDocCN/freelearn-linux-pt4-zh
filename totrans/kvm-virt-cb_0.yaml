- en: The foundation of most modern cloud deployments is some sort of virtualization
    technology, such as Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). KVM has been part of the
    mainstream Linux kernel since version 2.6.20, released in February 2007, and since
    then has enjoyed wide system adoption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Virtualization in general not only provides a way to fully utilize server resources,
    but also allows greater multitenancy, along with running various workloads on
    the same system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The OpenStack cloud operating system uses KVM as its default compute driver,
    providing a centralized way of managing the lifecycle of virtual machines: from
    building, resizing, and migrating to pausing and terminating.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is about KVM and how to build and manage virtual machines in the most
    efficient way. Unlike containerization solutions such as Docker, KVM is designed
    to run an entire operating system rather than a single process. Although containerization
    has its advantages, full virtualization provides extra security by having the
    hypervisor layer between the guest OS and the host and added stability by running
    different guest kernels (kernel panic of the guest instance will not bring the
    entire host down) or entirely different operating systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book takes a rather direct and pragmatic step-by-step approach--you will
    learn how to create custom guest images, install and configure QEMU and libvirt,
    resize and migrate instances, deploy monitoring, and provision guests using OpenStack
    and Python.
