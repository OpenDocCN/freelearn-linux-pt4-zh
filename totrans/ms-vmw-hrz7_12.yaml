    with their virtual desktop machine. By this, we mean configuring things such as
    whether or not you can cut-and-paste text between the endpoint device running
    the client and the virtual desktop machine.

- en: The first thing you need to do is create an **organizational unit** (**OU**)
    for your virtual desktop machines. It's a best practice to have a separate OU
    for virtual desktop machines to ensure that you don't end up applying the wrong
    policies to them, such as those that are used for your physical machines, which
    could potentially contain components that may impact performance and vice versa.
    You don't want to apply VDI-based policies to the physical desktop estate.
  prefs: []

    use cases, for example, you may want a different OU for each different department
    within your organization. This would then allow you to apply different VDI-based
    policies to each OU. For example, a particular department might use high-end graphics,
    which would mean that PCoIP will be configured to deliver that richer experience
    over that of a standard office user, or it could be a policy specific to LAN users,
    where the policy governs the behavior based on the available bandwidth.
