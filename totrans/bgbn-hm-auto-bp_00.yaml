    distribution as well as normal (and powerful) distributions like Debian or Ubuntu,
    and to which the user can connect several external peripherals via two dedicated
    expansion connectors.

    embedded board, the BeagleBone Black system is a state-of-the-art device that
    allows the user to build powerful and versatile monitoring and controlling applications.

    use a Debian-based system with a little modification, or they may use another
    GNU/Linux distribution, but with a little effort mainly for the installation of
    the cross-compiling tool. Systems such as Windows, Mac OS, or similar are *not*
