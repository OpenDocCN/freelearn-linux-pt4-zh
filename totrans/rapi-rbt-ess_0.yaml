- en: There have been many recent technological advances that have really changed
    the way we live, work, and play. The television, the computer, and the cell phone
    all have dramatically affected our lives. Each of these generally started out
    with a few early adopters, for the most part, individuals with lots of resources
    that were able to afford the new technology. However, soon after, there was a
    movement to make the technology more affordable for a wider range of people.

- en: The latest technological movement is robotics. The number, kind, and use of
    robots is growing dramatically. The first of these robots were developed in university
    labs or in military research centers. However, just as with the adaption of the
    computer, there is already a growing grassroots movement of do-it-yourself developers
    that has sprung up to make robots a part of our everyday life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This movement has been fueled by inexpensive hardware and free, open source
    software. However, it has also been enabled by a community of developers who are
    willing to help others get started or overcome challenges that they have experienced.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is offered in the spirit of this do-it-yourself movement. Inside the
    book, you'll find details about how to take Raspberry Pi B 2, an inexpensive,
    small, but versatile computer, and marry it with inexpensive hardware and open
    source software to build a bipedal robot that can walk, sense barriers, and even
    see its surroundings.

    you may be creating the next generation of thinking, walking, sensing machines
    that will be at the heart of the robotic revolution.
