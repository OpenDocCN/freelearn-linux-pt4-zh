<p class="western"><span><span><span><span>This book is intended for any individual who wants to learn how to use Linux as a server or desktop machine in their environment. Whether you are a developer, fledgling system administrator, or tech lover with no previous Linux administration background, you will be able to start your journey in Linux using CentOS 7 with the help of this book.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span><span><span>Even though this book is written for novice Linux users, a seasoned Linux user will also have something to take away from each chapter. You don't need any prior experience of working with the Linux command line for this book. Most new users of Linux find it difficult to work with the command line and, occasionally, the choice as to which Linux distribution to start with may be confusing. You will learn Linux using CentOS 7, which is one of the most popular and stable Linux distributions based on RHEL 7.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span><span><span>Some of the key features of this book are as follows:</span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="western"><span><span><span><span>No previous Linux environment experience is required prior to reading this book </span></span></span></span></li>
<li class="western"><span><span><span><span>Readers will become comfortable with a popular and stable Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution</span></span></span></span></li>
<li class="western"><span><span><span><span>Concise content, with a thorough coverage of important utilities</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="western"><span>The book is written in such a manner that any computer user with basic familiarity with operating systems can start using it. The only prerequisite is to have some decent hardware on which you can install CentOS 7 and practice the commands covered.</span></p>

<p class="western"><span><span><span><span>As always, we have put our best efforts into making this book's content relevant to user requirements. All command lines covered in this book are based on CentOS 7. You can use any minor release of CentOS 7, from CentOS 7.1 through to CentOS 7.6. A CentOS 7 operating system is the only requirement for this book. For beginners, however, it is recommended installing and practicing CentOS 7 in any desktop virtualization application, such as VirtualBox, and VMWare Workstation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span><span><span>For Windows and macOS users who would like to use a virtual environment, they can use VMWare or VirtualBox to set up CentOS 7 and execute the given command-line examples. For those who are new to Linux, the installation of CentOS 7 is covered in <a href="fa67ebb4-281e-44be-a28e-c3fb587bebc7.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with CentOS 7</em>.</span></span></span></span></p>
