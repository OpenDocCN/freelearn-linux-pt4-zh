<p>Physical security (see <a href="0803c1ef-5bc3-4bef-8777-001d39a61b7d.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Physical Security and Environmental Controls</em>) protects an organization and its computing assets and resources from damage, destruction, and theft. Logical security is not the opposite of physical security. Rather, it's another part of security as a whole. Logical security has the same overall objectives as physical security—to protect, prevent, detect, and deter intrusions against a very valuable resource for any organization.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will look at the various methods, procedures, and technology used to implement logical security policies to safeguard the data, software, and computing assets of an organization. We will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access control</li>
<li>Data encryption</li>
<li>Data retention and disposal</li>
<li>Physically destroying a disk drive</li>
<li>OS, system, application, and hardware hardening</li>
</ul>

<p>Earlier, we talked about access control on routers (see <a href="55df1944-a0aa-4823-b7b2-c9316ce72b14.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Security Systems and Protocols</em>) and the use of <strong>access control lists</strong> (<strong>ACLs</strong>). However, the access control we talk about in the context of logical security, while different in structure and procedure, has the same overall objective—preventing unauthorized access to the software and data assets of a system.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Access control is a method of logical security that identifies what resources an individual user may access, modify, create, or remove. Using access controls, a system administrator can allow or restrict access to certain system assets and resources on an individual or group basis. Each authenticated and authorized user or group is assigned a <strong>security identifier</strong> (<strong>SID</strong>), which is the identity of a system record that details the access permissions and rights of a user or group; that is, their security principals.</p>
<p>When a user, as an individual or as a member of a group, requests access to a system resource or asset, the SID record informs the <strong>operating system</strong> (<strong>OS</strong>) of the access permissions and rights that are granted to that user. Typically, the requested access comes in the form of an attempt to read or write the resource. In response, the OS scans the corresponding SID to determine whether it can permit the requested access.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Granting access to system resources may be based on several different criteria. While access permissions and rights may be solely based on who the user is, the administration of granting access to individual users—a process called <strong>discretionary access control</strong> (<strong>DAC</strong>)—may be okay in a small organization. However, in a larger enterprise, especially one spread out geographically, the criteria that's used to assign permissions could come from a variety of identification factors, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group access control</strong>: Group access defines a common set of rights and permissions for individual users that have been assigned to the group by the system administrators. Group accounts are typically generic in nature, such as a group account for general users or the accounting department. Group accounts and group access control allow administrators to implement an access control policy to groups of users that require the same permission sets.</li>
<li><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC)</strong>: What a user does—that is, what his or her title, job, task, duties, or responsibilities may be—can define the permissions and rights the individual needs to perform or fulfill that assignment. Often, RBAC defines groups of users who perform essentially the same tasks and require the same resources.</li>
<li><strong>Specific criteria access control</strong>: Especially on geographically dispersed networks, certain criteria may define the access criteria of a group account. Some of the more common criteria are as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: A location access control could restrict access to users based on their location, such as a branch office or remote manufacturing site.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: Here, access can occur only on certain days and only at certain times of the day. For example, a company policy may restrict access to financial data to only Monday through Thursday and only between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM each day, and perhaps only to the users in the finance group.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction type</strong>: On an online transaction processing system, access to the supporting database elements is specific to each of the various transaction types. Permissions may also be associated with the user's identity or a group account.</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: Access control can also define permissions and rights based on online or offline application types and purposes. Typically, the rights and permissions of the logged in user extend to any application the user executes. This control, the <strong>user account control</strong> (<strong>UAC</strong>), if disabled, extends the permissions of applications beyond a user's rights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to applying access control to users in various contexts, access control can also be applied to a system's individual hardware and software components and for the same purposes. Access control mechanisms can restrict access and the use of software and hardware components.</p>

<p>Beyond the permissions that are assigned to individual directories, folders, and files, filesystems, such as Windows NTFS, Unix POSIX, and Linux NFS, have an ACL that specifies user and group rights and permissions to the programs and files within the filesystem. Each item in the filesystem has an <strong>access control entry</strong> (<strong>ACE</strong>) in the filesystem ACL that defines the permissions associated with each individual item.</p>
<p>The permissions in an ACE are very much like those of individual filesystem elements, in that they specify who has access rights and what each group or user may do with an element. The following screenshot shows the Windows <span class="packt_screen">Advanced Security Settings for Documents</span> dialog box on which permissions and rights can be assigned to groups and users on folders and files:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1073 image-border" src="Images/12d7bf9c-edf8-44d5-b268-67f23fa10ab7.jpg" style="width:66.67em;height:36.00em;" width="800" height="432"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The Windows Advanced Security Settings is used to set permissions and rights for folders and files</div>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As illustrated in the preceding screenshot, the permissions and rights of this directory belong to three distinct levels of access—file owner, group owner (as in, the group of the file owner), and all other users, which in this case are <kbd>root</kbd>, <kbd>root</kbd>, and <kbd>other</kbd>. Characters indicating read (<kbd>r</kbd>), write (<kbd>w</kbd>), and execute (<kbd>x</kbd>) represent the permissions for each level. The user/owner of the <kbd>/usr</kbd> directory in the preceding screenshot has read, write, and execute permissions. Write permission includes both modifying and deleting. The <kbd>root</kbd> group and all other users and groups only have read and execute permissions, which means that they can open, scan, display, and, if the file is a program or script, run it.</p>

<p>Controlling access to internal or peripheral devices of servers, and other networking devices, such as a router or switch, must be a vital part of any network security policy. Modern peripheral devices are essentially computers themselves, which makes them potential targets for attacks on a network. Some ways to limit unauthorized access to these devices are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrator passwords</strong>: All peripheral devices include a configuration process that sets their performance and security settings, including an administrator-level password. Setting this password helps to prevent unauthorized access to a device's configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Apply patches and firmware upgrades</strong>: Most internal and peripheral devices have associated software that provides an interface to the computer or operating system. Keeping this software up-to-date can ensure that the security features are up-to-date as well.</li>
<li><strong>Disable features not in use</strong>: Just like any system, computer devices and peripherals can include features that are not in use. Disabling these features hardens the devices.</li>
<li><strong>Limit access control</strong>: These include any access capabilities that allow users to login to modify settings and configuration. Only administrators should have access to these, as well as print servers, network nodes that print directly to a device, and administrator workstations that manage the device and its network.</li>
<li><strong>Isolate devices</strong>: Peripheral devices should be a part of an internal network to which external access is not available.</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition and specification of who has access to an organization's servers and networks and what they can do should be in a security or access control policy. This policy should detail the access rights and privileges of the various user and administrator groups. Administrator access control should restrict access to only those technicians who install, configure, manage, and monitor the software or hardware that performs access control on system resources. Even within the general group of system administrators, access can vary according to responsibility, position, skills, and knowledge.</p>

<p>The Windows OS provides for two types of group accounts in its <strong>Active Directory</strong> (<strong>AD</strong>) services. A new group must have a group type, either a security group or a distribution group. A security group allows you to assign access control and file and folder rights and permissions. A distribution group is only to be used with distributed email messages. Security groups typically reflect an organization's group policies and allow for flexibility in both user and hardware security settings. On the other hand, a distribution group is strictly for distributing messages and not for security purposes.</p>

<p>NAC is a software or integrated device that does just what its name implies—it controls access to a network. NAC implements an organization's security policy, enforces logical compliance, and the administration of a network's access control rules. NAC applies to wired and wireless networks, as well as cloud computing.</p>
<p>NAC basically allows only authenticated devices and notes to gain access to a network's resources and monitors any access to the protected devices. Because NAC is made up of policies, procedures, utility, and application software, it's able to restrict user and device access and activity to the network-attached devices and resources. NAC covers all attached devices of a network.</p>

<p>Data or file encryption is the application of a cryptographic algorithm to the data or file so that when it's stored or transmitted, only those users or addressees with the appropriate access can open, execute, or apply its contents. Encryption and cryptography are expansive terms that cover a variety of approaches, applications, and methods to securing data and file assets. For the remainder of this discussion, we'll use the term encryption to cover data conversion through the application of cryptography.</p>
<p>At its most basic levels, encryption has three primary objectives—<strong>confidentiality, integrity, and availability</strong> (<strong>CIA</strong>). In addition, the CIA triad is usually extended to include authentication, authorization, and non-repudiation. Encryption is a data integrity and confidentiality protection mechanism.</p>

<p>On a computer system or network, data, including digital media, documents, and programming, can be in one of three states—in use, in transit, and at rest. Data in use has been decrypted and typically copied to memory for a logical operation. Data in transit needs protection from a variety of interception techniques (all of which are bad) as it moves across transmission lines. The same—if not more robust—protection is also a must for sensitive or confidential data that's stored on some form of data storage media, such as a hard disk, a flash drive, or perhaps even magnetic tape.</p>
<p>Encryption that's applied to data at rest on a storage device may have different levels of secured data. Encryption has applications on virtually all levels of a storage device, including an entire hard disk drive and, in some cases, removable media. <strong>Full-disk encryption</strong> (<strong>FDE</strong>) essentially creates a passageway between the storage medium and main memory. As data passes to the disk for storage, it is encrypted. As data is transferred to be placed in memory, it's decrypted. Virtually, the same encryption/decryption process may protect a disk partition, a filesystem, an individual file, or an individual data element, such a column, row, or cell in a spreadsheet or database.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Depending on your objective, there are several levels to removing data from a hard disk drive. At the lowest level (the least destructive) is <em>delete</em> and at the highest level (the most destructive) is <em>wipe.</em> Between these extremes is <em>erase</em> and <em>shred</em>. Users typically consider these terms (and their actions) to be different names for removing something semi-permanently or forever:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>: Typically, a delete action applies to removing one or more files, directories, or folders. However, in comparison to a hard wipe, the delete command is essentially a soft wipe. After deleting objects from the disk, the electrical impulses (bits) that make up the data remain in place. The delete function removes the index pointer to the file's location on the disk and its space is set to available. Before new data overwrites the space, an <em>undelete</em> action will restore the file by replacing its index pointer.</li>
<li><strong>Erase</strong>: Although users may think that delete and erase are essentially the same thing, erase removes files and folders permanently, so they are gone forever. Erasing data from a disk involves the use of special software tools, such as  <strong>Darik's Boot and Nuke</strong> (<span><strong>DBAN</strong>) </span>2.3.0, Eraser, and CBL Data Shredder. These tools overwrite a disk with random characters or binary zeroes (nulls), which permanently obliterates the data that was on the disk.</li>
<li><strong>Wipe</strong>: Wiping a disk drive is a bit more destructive than erasing it. When you wipe a storage device, whether it be secondary storage in a computer, on a cell phone, or a flash drive, you not only remove the active data, but any data that may still be recoverable. The software tools that perform an erase will also do a wipe. Some of the disk wipe software utilities include the ability to remotely format, erase, or wipe a hard disk.</li>
<li><strong>Shred</strong>: The shred action is basically a wipe, but limited to a single file or folder. Like the action in an erase or wipe, data is written over with random characters or zeroes.</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Many users believe that formatting removes any data or files on storage media. In fact, formatting a disk accomplishes just about the same as deleting a file—all the effected files and data appear to be gone. Like the deletion of an individual file, the data is still there. However, the formatting command removes all index entries, effectively removing all references to the existing data and marking all storage locations as free. As with a single file deletion, the data on a formatted disk is recoverable.</p>
<p>There are two distinct levels of formatting for a data storage device:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low-level formatting (LLF)</strong>: Typically, a hard disk's manufacturer performs this process before installing the storage device in a computer case. LLF places digital sector markers on the disk to map the storage medium into cylinders, tracks, and sectors.</li>
<li><strong>High-level formatting (HLF)</strong>: After low-level formatting, a disk still needs to be prepared for use by a OS. HLF adds the structures that the OS uses for partitions or logical volumes. Typically, HLF occurs during an OS installation or after installing a new unused hard disk.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>So, <em>does formatting a disk delete, or erase the data and files?</em> Well, it depends. The Windows OS provides a utility called <strong>Quick Format</strong>, which is essentially a <em>soft</em> wipe of a whole partition or disk. A quick format is just a big delete, which only gets rid of the indexing, which <em>is</em> quick. Windows also provides a format function that does what some call a hard wipe because it makes a single pass over the entire disk, thus writing zeroes to all bits.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>After wiping a disk at least once, if you want to be absolutely, positively, without-a-doubt sure that the disk and its now forgotten data are gone forever, you should physically destroy the disk drive. There are a number of ways to do this. The following are only a few of the ways that you can use to be confident that the disk will never be read:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove and destroy the disk platters</strong>: Assuming that the hard disk drive we are looking at stores its data on ferrous oxide coated platters, we can use a star screwdriver to open the drive's case and the collar that holds the disk platters on the spindle. Remove the platters and break them into pieces, burn them, or use whatever method you wish to otherwise destroy them. If you wish, you could also just hammer the platters without removing them. In either case, take the drive case, any loose electronics, and the platter pieces to an electronics recycler.</li>
<li><strong>Penetrate the disk drive</strong>: Piercing a drive by drilling holes through it (using a power drill, of course), driving large screws or nails through the case, or penetrating the case with anything that renders the drive unusable, does not necessarily insure that the data is unreadable.</li>
<li><strong>Shred the disk drive</strong>: This method works for all types of data storage devices, including internal and external disk drives (HDD or SDD), flash drives, CD-ROM, and DVD-ROM. Of course, for CD-ROM and DVD-ROM, only the recorded media needs to be destroyed. Industrial shredding services will shred these devices into small bits for a small fee, which provides the highest assurance that any data is beyond accessibility.</li>

<p>In general, hardening is the action that's taken to increase the security by reducing the vulnerability of a workstation, server, and network from exploitation. There are several levels of hardening, but the ones that you may encounter in the Server+ exam are <strong>OS hardening</strong>, <strong>system hardening</strong>, <strong>application hardening</strong>, and <strong>hardware hardening</strong>.</p>

<p>Securing an OS goes a long way in the process of securing its computer. The process of hardening an OS is slightly different for a client OS than for a server OS. Most of the steps are the same in either case, but let's focus on the hardening of a network server OS. Essentially, hardening an OS involves four major steps: disabling the unnecessary services, disabling unused TCP/UDP ports, installing only software that's needed for the tasks that are supported, and keeping the OS up to date by applying patches and updates.</p>
<p>Each of the major OSes have their own specific hardening practices, but there are some things that are appropriate for any OS. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unused software</strong>: That freeware application you downloaded out of curiosity or to solve a one-time purpose may, like just about all software, be a possible way in for a hacker. Remove any unused or unnecessary software and ensure that your policy restricts the ability of users to install non-standard software on their workstations.</li>
<li><strong>Group and user accounts</strong>: A common source of harm to a server is caused by users who, through an administrative error, discover that they have access to confidential or private information. All user passwords should adhere to a common password policy. Review the permissions and rights of all groups and user accounts on a regular basis.</li>
<li><strong>Patch management</strong>: While it's a good practice to keep an OS up to date with the latest patches, error fixes, service packs, and updates, be sure that a fix is appropriate to your system. This may involve testing and auditing before and after applying the patch.</li>
<li><strong>Establish and monitor baselines</strong>: A baseline establishes a standard level of performance or capacity on a server (or client) for its OS and components. An operational baseline that's generated at installation and updated after each modification to the system serves as the norm for comparison of the current performance level. A large variance to the baseline could indicate a possible security event.</li>
</ul>

<p>System hardening, also known as workstation or PC hardening, is the process that improves the security of a network node. There are hardening actions that apply to just about every part of a workstation, including its major hardware and software components and ranging to its overall security. In addition to the hardening steps that are applied to a server, there are some steps that are specific to a network workstation, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User account policies</strong>: Although technically a server-level policy, user account policies and permissions do impact a user's ability to access a network, as well as the software and data on a local host. The password policy should require periodic password change, a specified length, reuse policies, and login-failure lockout criteria. User rights and permissions should also be in line with the security policies and an access control model.</li>
<li><strong>Physical security</strong>: Users should know and understand the physical security policies that are applicable to their workstations. This should include the policies on the control of entrances and exits to a building, a work room, or an office or cubicle. A <em>clean desk</em> policy enforces the security of physical documents and access to a computer. Users should also be aware of their responsibilities in the event of a catastrophic event.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong>: Stopping short of a key-logger, record all system and network interactions by a user, including login and logout times, applications and data accessed, and any security-related program or data access attempts, successes, and failures.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic patch application</strong>: Fixes and patches that are performed on workstation OSes and applications can be posted automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Disable sharing</strong>: Disable file and device sharing to prevent network-based access through a shared system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Application hardening is also known as application shielding because this process changes the binary code of the application or utility to make it more resistant to tampering. Application software can be subject to reverse-engineering, intrusion, and in some cases, code insertion. Not only does the hardening process protect the application code itself, but in many cases, it protects the data from being accessed by the application. Common threats to application software include the discovery of a vulnerability, virus and other malware attacks, and possibly theft of the application and data.</p>

<p>Most of the hardware hardening process on a host system is in the BIOS/UEFI configuration settings. Setting a password to access the configuration settings, disabling <strong>Wake-on-LAN</strong> (<strong>WOL</strong>), if available, and setting the boot device sequence to eliminate a remote boot initiation are just three of the settings that can help prevent intrusion of the host system.</p>

<p>An essential part of securing a network is to secure the network's infrastructure by hardening the network devices. However, network devices from different manufacturers may require slightly different steps to harden their devices. Generally, hardening a router, firewall, switch, bridge, and other devices accomplishes the same goals using roughly the same process. Some of the common steps that are used to harden a network device include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backup configuration</strong>: This stores copies of the current configuration and settings of the device OS in a secure location</li>
<li><strong>Disable admin protocols</strong>: Disables any administrative protocols not in use, such as Telnet and <strong>File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>FTP</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Disable unused or unnecessary services and protocols</strong>: Disables device services and protocols that are not in use, such as any discovery protocols, HTTP, SNMP, and the <span><strong>Bootstrap Protocol</strong>  (</span><strong>BOOTP</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Encrypt configuration files</strong>: When transmitting configuration files, apply encryption to safeguard their contents</li>
<li><strong>Secure access</strong>: Use a strong password policy for access to the device console and its auxiliary and virtual Terminal interfaces</li>
<li><strong>Define security standards</strong>: Define security standards and procedures specifically for network devices and their operation</li>
</ul>

<p>Even after hardening a server and network, additional measures can enhance their overall security. When a client connects to a host, the connection creates two terminating points: an entry point and an endpoint. An entry point opens at the client end of the connection, and the server (its interface port) becomes the endpoint. Endpoint security has rapidly become an issue due to the increase of <strong>b</strong><span><strong>ring your own device</strong> (</span><strong>BYOD</strong>) policies in a growing number of companies. In these environments, as well as several forms of remote access, the security on the endpoint must be focused on the detection and prevention of intrusion and malware.</p>
<p>An <strong>intrusion detection system</strong> (<strong>IDS</strong>) can be either hardware or software. Regardless, an IDS scans network traffic (inbound or outbound) to identify malware or, a pattern of suspicious behavior, and monitoring system configuration settings for inadvertent changes. An endpoint IDS is a <strong>security information and event management</strong> (<strong>SIEM</strong>) application that monitors, scans, and gathers information on the endpoint's traffic. Some IDSes allow for performance and event thresholds above which an alert can go to the administrator. On a network, the endpoint and entry point IDS devices are designated as <strong>network-based intrusion detection system</strong> (<strong>NIDS</strong>) or <strong><span>host-based intrusion detection system</span></strong> (<strong>HIDS</strong>). A NIDS is an independent device that monitors network traffic before it's passed to a network device. A HIDS can be either hardware or software that's attached to, or running on, a host computer.</p>
<p>There are essentially two types of IDS—<strong>signature</strong> and <strong>heuristic</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A signature-based IDS extracts a segment of code from the suspected message, performs an algorithm on it, and then compares it to a database of known malware. If there is a match, the message is deleted, relevant log entries are created, and the sender is typically barred from the network.</li>
<li>A heuristic IDS, that is, an anomaly-based IDS, compares the actions of the suspected program to a model of acceptable actions. If there is a match, there is the possibility of a false positive (a match, yet the message is valid and not malware) or a false negative (not a match, yet the message is invalid and possibly malware), but otherwise the IDS may block the source address from entering the network.</li>
</ul>

<p>Access controls identify the resources an individual user may access, modify, create, or remove. Access controls allow or restrict access to system assets and resources. In larger organizations, the criteria to assign permissions may come from different identification factors, such as a group, a role, a location, a time, day or date, or a transaction type, or the application in use.</p>
<p>Access controls can apply to hardware and software. Filesystem ACLs specify rights and permissions. Each file or object has an ACE that defines its permissions for its owner, group, and other users. Each level may have read, write, and execute permissions. Access control for devices is done through administrator passwords, the application of patches and upgrades, disabling unused features, limiting access, and by isolating devices.</p>
<p>Encryption applies a cryptographic algorithm to a data or file to restrict its contents to those with appropriate access. Encryption and security have three primary objectives: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. CIA extends to include authentication, authorization, and non-repudiation. Data can be in use, in transit, or at rest.</p>
<p>There are several ways to remove data from a disk drive—delete, erase, wipe, and shred.</p>
<p>Formatting removes all index entries, but the data itself is still on the disk. Data on a formatted disk is recoverable. Low-level formatting places digital sector markers on the disk to map the storage medium into cylinders, tracks, and sectors. High-level formatting adds the structures that an OS uses for partitions or logical volumes. There are several ways to destroy a disk drive: removing and destroying the platters, penetrating the drive, or shredding the drive, among others.</p>
<p>Hardening increases the security of a system or device by reducing its vulnerability. The different types of hardening are OS hardening, system hardening, application hardening, and hardware hardening. Hardening an OS involves disabling unneeded services and unused TCP/UDP ports, installing only the required software, and applying patches and updates. In addition, hardening may include removing unused software, auditing group and user permissions, exercising patch management, and establishing and monitoring baselines.</p>

<p>System hardening improves the security of a network node. This can include enforcing user account policies, implementing a strong password policy, adhering to physical security policies, activating system logging, and disabling file and device sharing. Application hardening changes the binary code of the application to make it resistant to tampering, reverse-engineering, intrusion, and code insertion. Hardware hardening on a host system is done through BIOS/UEFI configuration settings, including setting a BIOS/UEFI password, disabling WoL, and setting the boot sequence to eliminate a remote boot. Hardening network devices includes backing up device configurations, disabling unused administrative protocols and services, encrypting configuration files, and securing access.</p>
<p>IDS is a piece of hardware or software that scans network traffic for malware or a pattern of suspicious behavior. An endpoint IDS monitors, scans, and gathers information on the endpoint's traffic. A NIDS monitors network traffic before a network device. A HIDS is a piece of hardware or software on a host computer. The two types of IDS are signature and heuristic.</p>
