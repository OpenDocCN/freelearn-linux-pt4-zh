    success of the BBC Micro for teaching computer programming to a generation. The
    Raspberry Pi Foundation set out to do the same in today's world, where you don't
    need to know how to write software to use a computer. At the time of printing,
    the Raspberry Pi Foundation had shipped over *2.5 million* units, and it is safe
    to say that they have exceeded their expectations!

    case of the Raspberry Pi, it all began in 2006 when several concept versions of
    the Raspberry Pi based on the Atmel 8-bit ATMega664 microcontroller were developed.
    Another concept based on a USB memory stick with an ARM processor (similar to
    what is used in the current Raspberry Pi) was created after that. It took six
    years of hardware development to create the Raspberry Pi that we know and love
    today!

    Pi were built. These boards were slightly larger than the current version to allow
    the Raspberry Pi Foundation, to debug the device and confirm that it would all
    work as expected. Twenty-five beta versions of the Raspberry Pi were assembled
    in December 2011 and auctioned to raise money for the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
    Only a single small error with these was found and corrected for the first production
    run.

    overseas in China and Taiwan. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the Ethernet
    jack on the Raspberry Pi being incorrectly substituted with an incompatible part.
    This led to some minor shipping delays, but all the Raspberry Pi boards were delivered
    within weeks of their due date. As a bonus, the foundation was able to upgrade
    the Model A Raspberry Pi to 256 MB of RAM instead of the 128 MB that was planned.
    This upgrade in memory size allowed the Raspberry Pi to perform even more amazing
    tasks, such as real-time image processing.

    Raspberry Pi, this is done by the first and second stage bootloaders. The first
    stage bootloader is programmed into the ROM of the Raspberry Pi during manufacture
    and cannot be modified. The second and third stage bootloaders are stored on the
    SD card and are automatically run by the previous stage bootloader.

    the kernel needs to know what it is and how to use it. The vast majority of devices
    on the market are supported by the Linux kernel, with more being added all the
    time. A good example of this is when you plug a USB drive into your Raspberry
    Pi. In this case, the kernel automatically detects the USB drive and notifies
    a daemon that automatically makes the files available to you.

    init. This program is designed to finish the initialization of the Raspberry Pi,
