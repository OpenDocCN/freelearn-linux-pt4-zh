<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You need the following prerequisites to get the most from this book.</p><div class="section" title="Software prerequisites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec03"/>Software prerequisites</h2></div></div></div><p>Regarding the software, the reader should have a little knowledge of a non-graphical text editor such as vi, emacs, or nano. Even if the reader can connect an LCD display, a keyboard, and a mouse directly to the BeagleBone Black and can use the graphical interface, we assume in this book that the reader is able to do little modifications to text files by using a text-only editor.</p><p>The host computer, that is, the computer the reader will use to cross-compile the code and/or manage the BeagleBone Black, is assumed to be running a GNU/Linux-based distribution. My host PC is running an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but the reader can also use a Debian-based system with a little modification, or they may use another GNU/Linux distribution, but with a little effort mainly for the installation of the cross-compiling tool. Systems such as Windows, Mac OS, or similar are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> covered in this book due to the fact that we should not use low technology systems to develop code for a high technology system!</p><p>Knowing how a C compiler works and how to manage a <code class="literal">Makefile</code> could help, but don't worry, all examples start from the very beginning so that even a non-skilled developer should be able to do the job.</p><p>This book will present some kernel programming techniques, but it must not be taken as a <span class="emphasis"><em>kernel programming course</em></span>. You need a proper book for such a topic! However, each example is well documented, and the reader will find several suggested resources.</p><p>Regarding the kernel, I'd like to state that by default I used the onboard kernel, that is, version 3.8.13. However, in some chapters, I used a self-compiled kernel, version 3.13.11; in that case, I gave a little tutorial about how to do the job.</p><p>If you're using a newer kernel release you may get minor issues, but you should be able to port whatever I did without problems. In the case that you are using a very recent kernel, please consider that the cape manager file <code class="literal">/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots</code> has been relocated to <code class="literal">/sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots</code>, so you have to change all related commands accordingly.</p><p>As a final note, I assume that the reader knows how to connect a BeagleBone Black board to the Internet in order to download a package or a generic file.</p></div><div class="section" title="Hardware prerequisites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec04"/>Hardware prerequisites</h2></div></div></div><p>In this book, all code is developed for the BeagleBone Black board revision <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span>, but the reader can use an older revision without any issues; in fact, the code is portable and it should work on other systems too!</p><p>Regarding the computer peripherals used in this book, I reported in each chapter where I got the hardware and where the reader can buy it, but, of course, they can decide to surf the Internet in order to find a better and cheaper offer. A note on where to find the datasheet is also present.</p><p>The reader should not have any difficulty in connecting the hardware presented in this book with the BeagleBone Black since the connections are very few and well documented. Readers don't require any particular hardware skills (apart from knowing how to use a soldering iron); however, a small amount of knowledge of electronics may help.</p><p>During the reading, I'm going to refer to BeagleBone Black's pins, especially the ones on the expansion connectors. All the pins used are explained, but, if needed, you can find a complete description of BeagleBone Black's connectors at <a class="ulink" href="http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:Cape_Expansion_Headers">http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:Cape_Expansion_Headers</a>.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>If you are a developer who wants to learn how to use embedded machine learning capabilities and get access to a GNU/Linux device driver to collect data from a peripheral or to control a device, this is the book for you.</p><p>If you wish to manage your home by implementing different kinds of home automation devices that can interact with a smartphone, tablet, or PC, or if you are just working standalone, have some hardware or electrical engineering experience then this book is for you. Knowing the basics of C, Bash, Python, PHP, and JavaScript programming in a UNIX environment is also required.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><div class="section" title="Codes and command lines"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec05"/>Codes and command lines</h2></div></div></div><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "To get the preceding kernel messages, we can use both the <code class="literal">dmesg</code> and <code class="literal">tail -f /var/log/kern.log</code> commands."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE status (
   n VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
   v VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (n)
) ENGINE=MEMORY;</pre></div><p>Any command line input or output given on the BeagleBone Black is written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>root@beaglebone:~# make CFLAGS="-Wall -O2" helloworldcc -Wall -O2 helloworld.c -o helloworld</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Any command line input or output given on my host computer as a <span class="emphasis"><em>non-privileged user</em></span> is written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ tail -f /var/log/kern.log</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>When I need to give a command as a privileged user (root) on my host computer the command line input or output is then written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong># /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The reader should notice that all the privileged commands can also be executed by a normal user by using the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command with the form:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ sudo &lt;command&gt;</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>So, the preceding command can be executed by a normal user as:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</strong></span>
</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Kernel and logging messages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec06"/>Kernel and logging messages</h2></div></div></div><p>On several GNU/Linux distributions, a kernel message has the following form:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>Oct 27 10:41:56 hulk kernel: [46692.664196] usb 2-1.1: new high-speed USB device number 12 using ehci-pci</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>This is a quite long line for this book, which is why the characters from the beginning of the line until the point where the real information begins are dropped. So, in the preceding example, the line's output will be reported as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>usb 2-1.1: new high-speed USB device number 12 using ehci-pci</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Long outputs and repeated or less important lines in a terminal are dropped by replacing them with three dots (...), as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>output begin</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>output line 1</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>output line 2</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>...</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>output line 10</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>output end</strong></span>
</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="File modifications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec07"/>File modifications</h2></div></div></div><p>When the reader should modify a text file, I'm going to use the unified context <code class="literal">diff</code> format, since this is a very efficient and compact way to represent a text modification. This format can be obtained by using the <code class="literal">diff</code> command with the <code class="literal">-u</code> option argument.</p><p>As a simple example, let's consider the following text in <code class="literal">file1.old</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">This is first line
This is the second line
This is the third line
...
...
This is the last line</pre></div><p>Suppose we have to modify the third line, as highlighted in the following snippet:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">This is first line
This is the second line
<span class="strong"><strong>This is the new third line modified by me</strong></span>
...
...
This is the last line</pre></div><p>The reader can easily understand that reporting the whole file each time for a simple modification is quite obscure and space consuming; however, by using the unified context <code class="literal">diff</code> format, the preceding modification can be written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">$ diff -u file1.old file1.new
--- file1.old 2015-03-23 14:49:04.354377460 +0100
+++ file1.new 2015-03-23 14:51:57.450373836 +0100
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
 This is first line
 This is the second line
-This is the third line
+This is the new third line modified by me
 ...
 ...
 This is the last line</pre></div><p>Now, the modification is very clear and is written in a compact form! It starts with a two-line header where the original file is preceded by <code class="literal">---</code> and the new file is preceded by <code class="literal">+++</code>, then there are one or more changed hunks that contain the line differences in the file. The preceding example has just one hunk where the unchanged lines are preceded by a space character, while the lines to be added are preceded by a <code class="literal">+</code> character, and the lines to be removed are preceded by a <code class="literal">–</code> character.</p></div><div class="section" title="Serial and network connections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec08"/>Serial and network connections</h2></div></div></div><p>In this book, I'm going to mainly use two different kinds of connections to interact with the BeagleBone Black board: the serial console and an SSH terminal. The former can be accessed directly via the connector J1 (never used in this book) or via an emulated way over the same USB connection that is used to power up the board, while the latter can be used via the the USB connection above or via an Ethernet connection.</p><p>The serial console is mainly used to manage the system from the command line. It's largely used to monitor the system, especially to take the kernel messages under control.</p><p>An SSH terminal is quite similar to the serial console even if is not exactly the same (for example, kernel messages do not automatically appear on a terminal); however, it can be used in the same manner as a serial console to give commands and edit files from the command line.</p><p>In the following chapters, I'm going to use a terminal on the serial console or over an SSH connection indifferently to give most of the commands and configuration settings needed to implement all the prototypes explained in this book.</p><p>To get access to the USB emulated serial console from your host PC, you can use the <code class="literal">minicon</code> command as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ minicom -o -D /dev/ttyACM0 </strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Note that on some systems, you may need root privileges to get access to the <code class="literal">/dev/ttyACM0</code> device (in this case, you can use the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command to override it).</p><p>As stated above, to get access to the SSH terminal, you can use the emulated Ethernet connection over the same USB cable that was used for the serial console. In fact, if your host PC is well configured, when you plug in the USB cable to power up your BeagleBone Black board, after a while, you should see a new cable connection with the IP address <code class="literal">192.168.7.1</code>. Then, you can use this new connection to get access to your BeagleBone Black by using the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ ssh root@192.168.7.2 </strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The last available communication channel is the Ethernet connection. It is used mainly to download files from the host PC or the Internet, and it can be established by connecting an Ethernet cable to the BeagleBone Black's Ethernet port and then configuring the port according to your LAN settings.</p><p>However, it's quite important to point out that you can also get connected to the Internet by using the emulated Ethernet connection that was presented before. In fact, by using the following commands on the host PC (obviously GNU/Linux based), you'll be able to use it as a router, allowing your BeagleBone Black board to surf the Internet as if it was connected to its real Ethernet port:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong># iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out- interface eth1 -j MASQUERADE</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong># iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth4 -j ACCEPT</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong># echo 1 &gt;&gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Then, on the BeagleBone Black, we should set the gateway through the USB cable by using the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>root@beaglebone:~# route add default gw 192.168.7.1</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Note that the <code class="literal">eth1</code> device is the preferred Internet connection on my host system, while the <code class="literal">eth4</code> device is the BeagleBone Black's device as viewed on my host system so you have to modify the command accordingly in order order to suite your needs.  </p></div><div class="section" title="Other conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec09"/>Other conventions</h2></div></div></div><p>
