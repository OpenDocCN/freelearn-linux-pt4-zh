<p>A large part of a network administrator's job is the administration of the network server or servers. This chapter covers the tools, components, tasks, processes, and management responsibilities that are used or performed to administer and maintain a server. </p>
<p>The duties and responsibilities of a server administrator (that is, the system administrator or network administrator) can vary from one organization to another, but, for the most part, there is a core group of tasks they perform or oversee that are essential to virtually any environment. These tasks and responsibilities generally include monitoring hardware and software performance, user administration, managing backup and recovery procedures, and the application of fixes and patches to name just a few. This part of the Server+ certification exam is process-oriented, meaning that it is less about what you know (although that is still important) and more about what you do. Let's get to it!</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network hardware administration</li>
<li>Server and network asset management</li>
<li>Server and system documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>The responsibilities of a network administrator on a day-to-day basis boil down to monitoring, reviewing, reacting, and installing, when needed. You need to understand that a network administrator and a system administrator aren't exactly the same thing, but the workplace commonly uses these titles interchangeably. A system administrator's responsibilities often include those of the network administrator, but most organizations limit the scope of a network administrator's responsibilities to the configuration, operation, and installation of network hardware. So, since we're talking about hardware administration, we'll use the network administration title.</p>

<p>The primary responsibility of a network administrator is to ensure that an organization's computer network conforms to the <strong>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability</strong> (<strong>CIA</strong>) model. To accomplish this, the administrator must keep the components of the network current, functional, and performing as required. Whether the duties of the administrator are a separate job description or embedded in the description of the <strong>system administrator</strong> (<strong>sysadmin</strong>) job, network hardware administration is an absolutely necessary activity. Regardless of where an organization defines the duties of its administrator, the definition should include these responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring, updating, and maintaining network hardware</li>
<li>Troubleshooting network issues</li>
<li>Designing network models</li>
<li>Implementing and monitoring hardware security policies</li>
<li>Configuring, managing, and monitoring data storage systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Other system and network areas may also fall under the responsibilities of the administrator or sysadmin. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing and installing network software</li>
<li>Managing and maintaining the <strong>network operating system</strong> (<strong>NOS</strong>)</li>
<li>Implementing and monitoring NOS and software security policies</li>
<li>Administering and coordinating cloud computing services</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a brief look at each of these areas and the responsibilities of the administrator.</p>

<p>An administrator's areas of responsibilities generally surround the network hardware in one form or another. For the most part, network hardware, ranging from the computer running the server software to the gateway router that connects to the outside world, have built-in performance and management utilities that monitor their operations. In some cases, protocols such as the <strong>Simple Network Management Protocol</strong> (<strong>SNMP</strong>) allow network devices to share information about status and preset conditions, as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<p>To perform the tasks that are required for network hardware administration, the administrator can interact with monitoring software from virtually any network workstation. However, in larger networks, such as a server farm or a data center, the administrator typically needs access to individual servers through a single console station. This interaction is capable through a few different technologies—<strong>Keyboard, Video, Mouse</strong> (<strong>KVM</strong>) switches, serial connections, and virtual administration consoles.</p>

<p>A KVM switch, such as the one shown in the following image, allows a centrally located administrator to control multiple computers individually through a single keyboard, video display, and mouse. The result is that the administrator's local devices replace those of the remote computer and function as if connected directly to the remote unit:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1040 image-border" src="Images/684539cf-1c17-49e6-8224-fea4fec2c464.jpg" style="width:29.08em;height:11.75em;" width="802" height="324"/></p>

<p>A KVM switch provides point-to-point administrative access to individual computers of a connected group through a single set of input/output devices, consisting of a keyboard, video display, and a mouse, from a central administrative site. A KVM, in effect, substitutes its devices for those of a selected computer. For example, the KVM switch shown in the preceding image is able to connect up to 16 computers. The administrator is able to select which of the connected computers is active and interact with it as if they were sitting in front of it.</p>
<p>There are two primary categories of KVM devices—access and control and application and technology. The categories overlap, and KVM switches typically fall into more than one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access and control:</strong> There are two types of access and control KVMs, based on the number of operators requiring access:
<ul>
<li>A single-user KVM, the most common, connects a single administrator at a central point to multiple remote computers</li>
<li>Multi-user KVMs, generally used in larger data centers where multiple administrators need access to network computers, essentially function to provide each user with what appears to be a single-user KVM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Application and technology:</strong> In some networks, all of the computers connected to the KVM are local and on others, the connected devices are remote. The primary two types of KVMs in this category are single-user analog devices and multi-user digital devices:
<ul>
<li>Analog KVMs directly connect to a computer through an <strong>unshielded twisted-pair</strong> (<strong>UTP</strong>) or coaxial cable. The KVM switch and the connected computers are usually on the same LAN.</li>
<li>Digital KVMs connect to local and remote computers by an <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>) address over an internet connection. A digital KVM is able to interact with a computer in the next room or half-way around the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another type of KVM switch is the <strong>USB enumerated KVM switch</strong>, that is, a hub-based KVM. When the active port on a multiport USB devices changes, an enumeration process takes place. This process, which also occurs when you insert or remove a USB device, initiates and activates the port. There is a small delay while this takes place, but this type of KVM works well in <strong>small office/home office</strong> (<strong>SOHO</strong>) situations. </p>
<p>The range of the three devices that connect to a KVM have relatively short communication ranges. The PS/2 (mini-DIN) and USB of legacy and current keyboards and mouse units and the digital video of most current displays start to weaken at about 5 meters (10 feet). Some are capable of maintaining their signals for up to 10 meters (33 feet), but that can depend on several factors. In situations in which you want to extend the effective range of these devices, a <strong>KVM extender</strong>, which works much like an Ethernet network repeater, can lengthen the range of the device's signals up to 150 meters (just under 500 feet) on UTP and much farther on fiber optic cable.</p>

<p>Virtually all server-level computers have at least one serial port, that is, a COM port. Typically, the connector for this port is a <strong>D-subminiature-9</strong> (<strong>DB-9</strong>) male connector, as shown in the following image. In its name, the <strong>D</strong> references its shape, the <strong>subminiature</strong> represents its smaller shape, and the <strong>9</strong> is for the number of pins in the connector. COM ports are typically DB-9 connectors on the newest computers. Another, although less common, is the DB-25 serial port, which is a D-shaped connector with 25 pins.</p>
<p>DB connectors are either male or female, meaning that they have pins, like the top connector in the following image, or they have pin receptacles, just like the bottom connector in the following image, which is commonly known a VGA connector on a PC:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1041 image-border" src="Images/b2490331-9ed8-40e8-9ad3-06b3a3b978c8.jpg" style="width:16.33em;height:24.75em;" width="493" height="747"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">DB-9 connectors, male (top) and female (bottom)</div>
<p>System and network administrators often connect to networking and internetworking devices through a serial interface to access system and network resources for configuring, monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance using a system console, that is, the root console or admin console. In general, a system console is a text entry and display device, such as a PC or Terminal, with data entry capabilities. Windows and Linux operating systems provide Terminal emulation software, such as <strong>Cmder</strong> and <strong>Console2</strong> for Windows or Terminator and <strong>Guake</strong> for Linux, which enable a PC to communicate with network devices over a serial connection.</p>

<p>System and network administration, in the context of hardware, deals mostly with the remote access by an administrator through software or hardware. Three of the network-based hardware/software administration tools you may encounter in the Server+ exam are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>KVM over IP switch</strong>: This provides an administrator with the capability to access local or remote systems over an IP network through a web browser. Using a KVM over IP switch, an administrator can monitor and manage remote hardware and software, power management, and internetworking devices. Some models can also record the video display, thus showing the operations performed.</li>
<li><strong>HP integrated Lights-Out (iLO)</strong>: A network hardware and system management tool that is proprietary to HP that provides the capability for systems management over the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC)</strong>: Another proprietary network management package that is one part of the Dell EMC enterprise infrastructure management system. Like iLO, administrators have the complete capability to manage remote network resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>On a widely distributed network, a centrally-located administrator is able to remotely manage, configure, and monitor the operating systems running remote servers and workstations. Some examples of the tools an administrator can use to manage the OS on remote systems are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)</strong>: This Microsoft package enables an administrator to manage the configuration and features of Windows Server releases after version 2008 R2 from a Windows OS Vista and later system.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)</strong>: This is another Microsoft system that provides remote access to network-connected systems that provide a GUI interface. The following screenshot shows the opening dialog box of RDP:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1042 image-border" src="Images/5fbf2515-4482-4719-9bff-f395eb94227f.jpg" style="width:38.08em;height:20.58em;" width="794" height="429"/></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Shell (SSH)</strong>: A software utility that facilitates OS administration and file transfers over a secure remote connection.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Network Computing (VNC)</strong>: This provides a GUI desktop through the <strong>Remote Frame Buffer</strong> (<strong>RFB</strong>) protocol that enables an administrator to control and manage a remote system over a network. VNC transmits all keyboard and mouse actions to the remote system and returns all generated video back to the controlling system. The following screenshot shows the connection dialog box for the VNC Server:</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Command line/shell commands</strong>: Both Windows and Linux have the capability to invoke control of a remote system from the command line or via shell scripts. On a Windows system, PowerShell facilities remote access and control. On a Linux system, the command-line feature over SSH provides remote system administration.</li>

<p>In any organization, the assets of the computing and networking functions are among the most expensive and typically most valuable to its mission. Of course, this is a generalization, but data and the systems that store, protect, and process it into information require special handling, security, and maintenance.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>An ITAM program should include the financial, acquisition, and management activities that are applied to any major asset group of an organization. The primary purpose of an ITAM is to support both the short-term and long-term (tactical and strategic, respectively) life and application of the IT and networking functions of an organization.</p>
<p>The core of any successful ITAM program is the detailed information regarding the hardware and software and its inventory. This information provides the basis for the use, acquisition, replacement, and retirement of IT hardware and software components. Most organizations manage hardware assets independently of software assets. Typically, the IT hardware asset management activities include acquisition, application, and retirement and disposal. Depending on the asset type, an IT asset may also be depreciable. In contrast, not all software assets fall under the guidelines of managed asset properties. Software assets, which are generally software licenses, upgrades, and installations, are most definitely assets, depreciable or not.</p>
<p>An IT asset management program is likely to be different in each organization. There are several factors, components, and elements that potentially include in an ITAM. Some of the differences are large, such as what's included and what's not, or small, such as serial numbers, tags, and other identifying items. However, ITAM programs are about managing the IT asset life cycle.</p>

<p>An IT <strong>life cycle asset management</strong> (<strong>LCAM</strong>) program provides valuable initial and ongoing information to an ITAM concerning when existing equipment is in its life cycle and when the organization should acquire replacement equipment or new technology. A LCAM has five general phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong>: When an organization acquires new equipment, it's added to the ITAM inventory and assigned an asset identity.</li>
<li><strong>Implement</strong>: Any necessary building changes or employee training takes place, along with the installation of the newly acquired equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain</strong>: A program of periodic and preventive maintenance keeps the asset running as it should.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>: A periodic review of the value and contribution of an asset determines whether the asset is still contributing to the overall mission of the organization. If not, its life cycle may be shortened.</li>
<li><strong>Dispose</strong>: Not all assets at their end-of-life are ready for the trash heap. Especially with IT assets, many have some life or usefulness left in them and recycling may be a better choice than trashing them. Some IT assets have rare metals or other compounds that recyclers can extract from motherboards and other devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, once a product has been useful between its purchase and its disposal, a replacement asset or a completely new technology may take its place, starting the cycle all over again.</p>

<p>Here are a few additional items you should about know for the Server+ exam, relating to asset management:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset inventory</strong>: Another term for asset management is asset inventory, which means the periodic collection of detailed data of existing and new IT assets.</li>
<li><strong>Asset tags</strong>: A relatively permanent sticker or tag with a unique identification number marks any physical asset as an accountable asset.</li>
<li><strong>Disposal/recycling</strong>: An <strong>IT asset disposition</strong> (<strong>ITAD</strong>) program should include both the options of recycling serviceable IT assets and the proper disposal of each item type. So, if donating the equipment to a local charitable organization or school or trading it in isn't an option, check with your local government to learn how to recycle electronic equipment or dispose of it in your location.</li>
<li><strong>End-of-life (EOL)</strong>: This is primarily a marketing term that refers to a product or service that is at the end of its life cycle and won't be available after a certain date. An organization with EOL devices installed knows that a new model, version, or edition of the device is to replace the EOL device. In most cases, the service and support for an EOL product may also be ending.</li>

<p>Documentation is both a boon and a bane to a system or network administrator. It's extremely valuable when something is going wrong. It can also be a nuisance when it's time to create or update it. Regardless of how you look at it, love it or hate it, documentation is a valuable resource that requires active support. This section looks at the myriad of types and content of documentation that should exist for a network server, inter-networking devices, workstations, and, really, just about anything that attaches to a network.</p>
<p>The Server+ exam's objectives identify nine separate types of system documentation. The following sections outline each of the documentation types identified in the Server+ objectives.</p>

<p>Each hardware component added to a system should come with a service manual, commonly also called a user manual or owner manual. In some cases, the service manual is more of an installation guide that also includes information on minor problem troubleshooting methods with the bulk of the service, repair, or configuration information available through the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>A service manual commonly contains some or all of the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front matter</strong>: This is the identification information on the first few pages of the manual that typically includes a cover page, introductory comments, product model and serial numbers, and a table of contents.</li>
<li><strong>Installation/configuration guidelines</strong>: Some service manuals have installation guidelines and configuration options and processes. Depending on the device or component, the installation and configuration processes are a combined process.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: In general, this portion of a service manual focuses on identifying common errors or problems with a device and perhaps the steps used to fix or remedy the issue. This section could contain detailed information on identifying a fault and its solution. It may just list the location of service centers or the customer support telephone numbers to call before attempting to repair the part.</li>
<li><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong>: Commonly asked questions related to the installation, configuration, and operations of the device, typically with short answers or explanations.</li>
<li><strong>Glossary and index</strong>: On occasion, a service manual may have a glossary to define and explain any technical or product-specific terms included in the manual and an alphabetical page index of its key terms and processes.</li>

<p>In far too many cases, the system administrator has an extremely detailed knowledge of the configurations of the various servers, a virtualized network environment, the storage attached network, and the inter-networking devices that connect to the internet. On the job, there is nothing the administrator doesn't know and can't fix, replace, or troubleshoot using only acquired knowledge. This administrator firmly believes that documentation really isn't necessary, because the administrator's knowledge would cover anything that could happen. Plus, keeping the documentation up to date is a major nuisance and a waste of time. Typically, in situations like this, management leaves the system and network administration to the administrator to do what is necessary, at least until an injury prevents the administrator from performing their duties.</p>
<p>While this scenario may seem like a scare tactic to convince you about the value of system and network documentation (only because it was), it's real focus is on developing a formalized process for creating, updating, and managing system and network documentation.</p>

<p>It's especially true in networking hardware that a picture is worth a long explanation. A diagram of a system's architecture, the topology of a network, or the data flow of a database system can quickly explain the structure, configuration, and functionality of an IT system. For the Server+ exam, you should be familiar with the following diagrams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture diagram</strong>: The system architecture is shown in the following diagram. These diagrams depict the major components of an infrastructure, system, or even applications. Prior to system development, an architecture diagram models the intended development.</li>
<li><strong>Data flow diagram (DFD)</strong>: A graphical depiction of how data flows through a system, network, or database. Typically, designers create DFDs in the early stages of a system's design. In the context of hardware, a DFD shows how data flows from device to device.</li>
<li><strong>Network diagram</strong>: A graphical representation of the devices and services in a local, wide, or other network. Network diagrams may show operating systems, routing protocols, and other services that are included:</li>

<p>The documentation that's generated and maintained by an organization is directly related to the size and complexity of its data center, network, and applications. Smaller organizations require the same core documentation as larger ones, but bigger networks typically have additional areas that require documentation. At a minimum, the documentation of a computer system or a network should have two primary components: baseline and recovery.</p>
<p>Baseline documentation formalizes the equipment, devices, software, cabling, and all other components that have been installed in the system and documented in major subsystems. The baseline also documents the performance levels of the newly configured system or subsystems that will provide a comparison base for future performance measurements.</p>
<p>Recovery documentation, such as a disaster recovery plan or a business continuity plan, contains the details of the processes, locations, staffing, and procedures that are used to restore operations in the event of different levels of interruptions.</p>
<p>Effective documentation has four primary qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear language</strong>: The language and style of the documentation allows all affected parties to fully understand its purpose, specifications, requirements, and instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Relative information</strong>: Rather than include additional content, reference any other documents that relate to or are associated with the subject matter of a specific documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: Each specific documentation should contain all of the pertinent information so that readers are aware of all aspects of operations, good and bad.</li>
<li><strong>Timely and accurate</strong>: Update all affected documentation within a reasonable time frame after applying modifications, expansions, upgrades, or patching to the system. Also include the results of troubleshooting reported problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, system documentation should exhibit four general characteristics: purpose, effectiveness, intended audience, and completeness. The goal is to achieve all four, if possible. Let's take a look at each of these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The purpose or objective of the documentation is to provide the information required to detail the makeup and configuration of the system, create training for the system stakeholders, outline potential component upgrades or replacements, and to designate team member responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness</strong>: In addition to the primary qualities that we've just listed, documentation must contain appropriate identification and replication procedures, as well as effective troubleshooting and resolution steps.</li>
<li><strong>Audience</strong>: The language should be free of technical jargon and terminology so that the intended audience can understand what you're talking about.</li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: The documentation of an information system or network must contain the appropriate information for all aspects, components, operations, and uses of the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone must have said at one point, <em>you can never have enough documentation!</em> This statement may be true, but only if the documentation is up to date.</p>

<p>There are several other types of documentation that relate to specific activities, such as the details of a system's configuration, the setup of an operating system, cabling specifications, service level agreements, change policies, personnel policies, authority structures, and the like. These documents tend to require less updating than, perhaps, main system documentation, but like it, they must be up to date.</p>

<p>Some documentation may be of a sensitive or confidential nature or direct to the processing or handling of classified or categorized documents, data, and outputs. In these cases, the government, its agencies, the military, and businesses of all sizes, must have a separate, specific, and documented policy on its storage, safeguarding, and transport.</p>
<p>The US military defines a secured facility called a <strong>sensitive compartmented information facility</strong> (<strong>SCIF</strong>) in which documents are in open storage, closed storage, or continuous operations. Many non-governmental organizations store sensitive documentation and other documents in locked, fire-proof cabinets, or small versions of bank vaults. In any case, sensitive documentation requires the same level of protection as the sensitive data or materials it references.</p>

<p>A server administrator has several duties and responsibilities, including maintaining network and storage hardware, troubleshooting network issues, and implementing and monitoring  security policies. The administrator's duties may also include installing software, maintaining the NOS, and implementing software security policies.</p>
<p>A KVM switch provides access and control for individual local or remote computers. We looked at two types of KVM devices—access and control and application and technology.  Examples of network-based hardware/software administration tools include KVM over IP, iLO , and iDRAC. The tools that are used to manage an OS on a remote system are RSAT, RDP, and SSH. VNC provides a GUI desktop. Command-line/shell commands can also control a remote system. Windows PowerShell facilities remote access and control and on a Linux system, command line over SSH provides remote system administration. An ITAM program manages  major asset groups and the IT asset life cycle.  An LCAM provides information on  life cycle and replacement equipment using  purchase, implement, maintain, support, and dispose.</p>
<p>Documentation should include the network server, inter-networking devices, and workstations. Types of documentation include service manuals, system and network documentation, architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, network diagrams, baseline documentation, and recovery documentation.  Effective documentation has clear language, relative information, completeness, and timely and accurate, as well as purpose, effectiveness, intended audience, and completeness. Documentation may include configuration, cable specifications, SLAs, and policies. Sensitive or classified documents, data, and outputs require special handling.</p>
