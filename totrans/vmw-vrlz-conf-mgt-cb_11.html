Select the role if you have multiple roles, and then you will enter the amazing world of VCM.</p><p>The console looks like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Understanding VCM Console" src="graphics/image_66_001.jpg"/></div><p>The very first blue row gives you the name of your collector server and the user connected to it.</p><p>On the next row, you have menu options. The most important of them are <span class="strong"><strong>Jobs</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Collect</strong></span>, while the rest allow you to select, copy, and export the data shown in the console.</p><p>On the third row, you have <span class="strong"><strong>Machine Group: –</strong></span> this is very important, as all the actions you will be performing from the left-hand slider will be done on the machines that are a part of the machine group you have selected here. For example, if you want to patch a machine that is not visible in the console view, but you are sure the machine is a part of the VCM, have a look at the machine group you have selected–the machine is not a part of the machine group you have selected from the top.</p><p>Next up is the slider on the left-hand side; the main options you get here are as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span><p>As shown on the previous screenshot, this is the default slider whenever you launch.
