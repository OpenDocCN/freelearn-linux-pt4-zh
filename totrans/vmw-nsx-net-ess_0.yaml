- en: NSX has transformed data center networking by introducing security and automation
    in Software Defined Data Centers (SDDC) . Software-defined networking is highly
    dynamic and helps organizations scale their data centers. By making use of the
    feature-rich services in VMware NSX, organizations can improve their CAPEX and
    OPEX. This book provides a comprehensive coverage of various software-defined
    networking features offered by VMware NSX.

    understanding NSX architecture is key for knowing features and various use case
    of NSX. Here we will be primarily covering Management Plane, Control Plane & data
    plane architecture followed by VXLAN architecture which will be essential for
    understanding the creation of Logical networks and troubleshooting virtual networks
    during upcoming modules'
