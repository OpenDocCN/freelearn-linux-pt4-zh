- en: Raspberry Pi is an extremely capable device that is within the reach of more
    people than ever. It is affordable enough for people to use for all sorts of different
    projects that weren't possible before. Some of these projects range from creating
    a media center for your TV to the autopilot functionality in an unmanned aerial
    vehicle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of these projects are based on Raspbian, and many of these have become
    their own distribution. They are still Raspbian at heart, but they have been customized
    for a specific purpose, and you can use the skills that you have learned from
    this book to work with them. This chapter runs through some of the different distributions.

    of the sound being played. These D/A converters plug into your Raspberry Pi and
    work as a very high-quality sound card. The following image shows the Volumio

    Raspberry Pi able to perform specialized tasks. These are only a small subset
    of some of the distributions available for the Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the
    popularity of the Raspberry Pi, more and more of these distributions will become
