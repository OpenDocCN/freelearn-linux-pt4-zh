Software-defined networking is highly dynamic and helps organizations scale their data centers. By making use of the feature-rich services in VMware NSX, organizations can improve their CAPEX and OPEX. This book provides a comprehensive coverage of various software-defined networking features offered by VMware NSX.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Network Virtualization">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Network Virtualization</em></span>, this chapter starts with evolution of virtualization and introduction to software defined data center followed by Network Virtualization discussion. We will also be covering how network virtualization has changed traditional datacenter networking by discussing various uses cases and features of VMware NSX.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2.  NSX Architecture">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>NSX Architecture</em></span>, understanding NSX architecture is key for knowing features and various use case of NSX. Here we will be primarily covering Management Plane, Control Plane &amp; data plane architecture followed by VXLAN architecture which will be essential for understanding the creation of Logical networks and troubleshooting virtual networks during upcoming modules</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. NSX Manager Installation and Configuration">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>NSX Manager Installation and Configuration</em></span>, we start this chapter with all requirements needed for a successful NSX installation by following step by step instruction on deploying and configuring NSX manager, NSX Controller and Data Plane software modules for Logical Switching, routing and Microsegmentation.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. NSX Virtual Networks and Logical Router">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>NSX Virtual Networks and Logical Router</em></span>, with the fundamental understanding on Overlay network in the previous chapters here we will be discussing about Logical Switching and distributed logical routing. Starting from configuration we cover step by step instructions on how to deploy Logical switches and establish a simple routing environment within the hypervisor layer.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5.  NSX Edge Services">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>NSX Edge Services</em></span>, we start this chapter with introduction to NSX Edge Services and various form factors. We also have discussions around NAT, DHCP, Load balancing and routing in this chapter and with that knowledge this chapter will be a complete network package that NSX offers in Software defined datacenter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. NSX Security Features">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>NSX Security Features</em></span>, end to end security is key to the success of any network topology. We start this chapter with introduction to traditional way of securing networks and how NSX helps to have a better control within Virtual Space. Distributed Firewall, Service Composer are some of the key highlight’s of this chapter</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. NSX Cross vCenter">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>NSX Cross vCenter</em></span>, one of the most exciting feature of NSX is Cross vCenter Server. Ability to manage multiple vSphere Environment and leverage NSX features is a game changer in modern day datacenter. In this chapter we will have a deep dive sessions on Architecture and deployment of NSX Cross vCenter with some design backing the topology discussed in the chapter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8.  NSX Troubleshooting">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>NSX Troubleshooting</em></span>, this chapter is all about applying what we learnt so far to identify and resolve NSX installation, registration and log process steps. The chapter is written in the same order how we started with the architecture of NSX – Management Plane, Control Plane and Data Plane troubleshooting followed by upgrade scenarios.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec2"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Primarily,we need NSX Manager,vCenter Server and ESXI Hosts with Local/remote storage.</p><p>Note that for an NSX Manager to participate in a cross-vCenter NSX deployment the following conditions are required.</p><p>Above configurations can be configured and tested even on a Nested ESXI environment ,however it is strongly not recommended to deploy it like that in a Production Environment. </p><p>For hardware compatibility matrix, please do refer VMware HCL guide:
