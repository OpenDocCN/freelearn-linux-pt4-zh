<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how an end user can connect to their virtual desktops and published applications using the various Horizon Client options that are available. We will also cover the different types of hardware-based endpoint devices that exist. The job of the client is to receive and display the screenshots of virtual desktop machines and the published applications on the end users' devices and then send the keystrokes and mouse movements back. These are the keystrokes and mouse movements from the end users client device, that get sent across the network back to the virtual desktop session.</p>
<p>We will discuss each of the available client options and why you would choose one over the other, based on the use case at hand. So, let's start by looking at the software-based client options.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>VMware Horizon Clients</li>
<li>Hardware clients</li>
<li>Accessing the desktop using a browser</li>
</ul>

<p>To get the best user experience, a user should connect to their virtual desktop machine from their client device using a piece of software called the Horizon View Client. The Horizon View Client is installed onto the local client device and allows users to communicate with the View Connection Server, allowing them to authenticate, select a desktop or application from a desktop pool they are entitled to, and then establish the connection between the client and the virtual desktop machine.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>In the more recent versions of Horizon, the software client has been unbundled from the major View releases, which means that the client downloads are updated more often and you don't have to wait for the next release of View. This reflects the fast pace at which new devices come to the market.</span></p>
<p>There are a number of different platform versions available, depending on the endpoint device you choose to use. In this section, we are going to give you a high-level overview of each of the available versions, along with any specific requirements.</p>
<p>You can download the different Horizon Clients by going to <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/viewclients">http://www.vmware.com/go/viewclients</a>.</p>

<p>The Horizon Client for Windows allows you to access your Windows virtual desktops and View-hosted applications from a Windows-based device and delivers the best possible user experience over either a LAN or a WAN connection.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows Horizon Client version 5.0 for Windows, which now has the same look and feel as Workspace ONE, connected to the example lab. You can see that there are two desktop pools available: one for published desktops and one for Windows 7 virtual desktop machines, along with a number of published apps:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3c09f133-5df3-497c-b899-4932a693197c.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The latest version of the Horizon Windows Client has the following new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for up to six monitors</strong>: It allows virtual desktop machines and published apps to run across six screens.</li>
<li><strong>Use published applications in multi-session mode</strong>: When multi-session mode is enabled for a published app, you can use multiple sessions of that particular published app when you log on to the Connection Server using different endpoint devices and clients. For example, if you open a published app in multi-session mode on client A, and then open exactly the same published app on client B, the published app remains open on client A and a new session of the published app opens on client B.</li>
<li><strong>TLS v1.0 is disabled</strong>: TLS v1.0 is no longer supported.</li>
<li><strong>Clipboard audit feature enhancements</strong>: The Horizon Agent can be configured to log information about copy and paste activity in a virtual desktop machine. A Horizon administrator can now configure the clipboard audit feature to record information about data that is copied from the client machine to the agent machine, about data that is copied from the agent machine to the client machine, or about data that is copied in both directions. This feature requires Horizon Agent 7.7.</li>
<li><strong>Select specific monitors to display published applications</strong>: If you have three or more monitors, you can select the monitors on which to display published applications.</li>
<li><strong>Geolocation redirection feature enhancements</strong>: You can now use the geolocation redirection feature with Google Chrome. To use this feature, a Horizon administrator must enable the VMware Horizon Geolocation Redirection Chrome plugin on the agent machine.</li>
<li><strong>VMware Virtual Print Redirection feature</strong>: With the VMware Virtual Print Redirection feature, you can print to a virtual printer or USB printer that is attached to the client system from a remote desktop or published application. This feature requires Horizon Agent 7.7.</li>
<li><strong>Drag and drop files and folders</strong>: You can drag and drop files and folders between the client system and Windows remote desktops and published applications. This feature requires Horizon Agent 7.7.</li>
<li><strong>Share Linux remote desktops</strong>: You can now use the Session Collaboration feature to share Linux remote desktops.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Virtual Printing on physical RDS host machines</strong>: The Virtual Printing feature for published desktops and published apps is now supported on physical RDS host servers. This feature requires Horizon Agent 7.7.</li>
<li><strong>Allow High-Efficiency Video Decoding (HEVC) with VMware Blast</strong>: When you allow HEVC for VMware Blast sessions, performance and image quality is improved if the client machine has a GPU that supports HEVC decoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the features in the latest Horizon Windows Client, you can read the release notes at the following link: <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Client-for-Windows/index.html">https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Client-for-Windows/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things we hear a lot from speaking with customers is that the endpoint device is irrelevant when you're connecting to a virtual desktop machine as it's just a dumb device to access the infrastructure and display my desktop screen, so that means I can buy the cheapest device possible and that will be fine, right?</p>
<p>The correct answer is that it depends on the use case for the users and what their requirements in terms of features and functionality are. Then, you can choose the most suitable endpoint device for them to connect from.</p>
<p>The other confusion that seems to be out there is whether there is a difference between a thin client and a Zero Client, and is there actually a difference at all?</p>
<p>In this section, we are going to cover the different types of hardware clients that are available, explain what each one is, and the best one to choose for a specific use case.</p>

<p>A thin client is a hardware endpoint device that's used to connect to the network and deliver a remote desktop/application session. Unlike a traditional PC that has its own memory, storage, and computing power to run applications on its own, complete with a full-blown OS and applications installed locally, a thin client has a cut-down OS, minimal CPU, memory, and often no storage and relies on the computing power of the servers running in the data center to do all of the processing. In this case, the thin client is used as a means to display the server's content to the end user.</p>
<p>Typically, a client device will have just enough processing power and resources to access and use the computing resources of the server. They have little or no storage (just enough to host their own internal OS) and more importantly no moving parts, which means they don't go wrong very often. Due to the reduced CPU and memory capacity, a thin client will draw a fraction of the power that a PC would normally need, meaning that thin clients should be cheaper to run and manage, and they have longer life cycles.</p>
<p>One thing they do have in common with a PC is that they have an operating system. A thin client will have its own local operating system installed, typically embedded on a flash card, and would be running the vendor's own cut-down version of a Linux distribution such as Dell Wyse ThinOS or Microsoft Windows Embedded. In addition, it would be running the appropriate client software to connect to the appropriate virtual desktop infrastructure, such as a Horizon Client with PCoIP to connect to VMware View-based virtual desktops and hosted apps, and the Citrix Receiver to connect to a Citrix-based infrastructure, and so on. Usually, a thin client will have all of the connection options installed, giving you the choice and flexibility to connect to different infrastructures.</p>
<p>Now, this is where you need to make the right choice regarding a device, as the operating system will be embedded onto the device. As we mentioned previously, the use case for the user will typically dictate the type of device. For example, if you are going to deploy unified communications with Microsoft Skype for Business, then you will need a Windows Embedded operating system, as it will more than likely require some of the Windows multimedia functionality. Always check before going off and buying the cheapest device.</p>
<p>There are also a couple of other points to bear in mind with thin clients. If the device is running on a local operating system, this will still need to be managed and maintained. The other consideration relates to licensing and the fact that you will need a Windows VDA license if you are connecting from a non-Windows device. This needs to be taken into account when looking at cost models and looking at TCO and ROI.</p>

<p>A <span>Z</span><span>ero</span> <span>Client</span> performs the same functionality as a thin client; however, instead of an operating system, a <span>Z</span><span>ero</span> <span>Client</span> will have a highly tuned on-board processor that's been specifically designed for one of the VDI protocols (PCoIP, HDX, or RemoteFX). For example, the VMware View-based <span>Z</span><span>ero</span> <span>Client</span>s would use the onboard Tera2 hardware chipset such as a Dell Wyse 5030/7030 or a 10ZiG V1200-P. These devices are still small, light, have no moving parts, and consume minimal power, just like a thin client.</p>
<p>The decoding and display processes take place on the silicon of the <span>Z</span><span>ero</span> <span>Client</span> and are more efficient. Since they are a hardware-based solution, they deliver better performance than if you were to use a software client with a standard CPU and GPU. <span>Z</span><span>ero</span> <span>Client</span>s boot up in just a few seconds as there is no operating system to load. As such, they are far more immune to viruses and other malware as they have next to no storage or data stored on them. This decreases the overall downtime of the device, meaning there are very few failures, mainly due to the lack of moving parts. This increases productivity to the end user.</p>
<p>A <span>Z</span><span>ero</span> <span>Client</span> device does not require any major maintenance and it rarely needs any updates, that is, unless there is a remarkable change or improvement to the VDI protocol or a rare BIOS-related update.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to watch out for. First is the licensing. Since these devices are not running on an operating system, you need to look at VDA licensing for using a non-Windows device. The final thing is that, if you change your VDI infrastructure from PCoIP to a new protocol, then the device cannot be used with a different protocol, so you lose the flexibility that you get with a thin client. However, you will get much better performance.</p>

<p>It is also possible to repurpose existing physical PCs so that they can be used as thin clients. There are a number of ways to achieve this, but you must ensure it is simple for the user to use and does not confuse the usage between a virtual desktop machine and the physical desktop machine that is sitting in front of them.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to do this. First is to use a local policy or group policy to lock down the Windows PC and change the shell to the Horizon Client only. The second is to use a third-party solution, such as the market leading ThinKiosk solution from ThinScale.</p>
<p>The ThinKiosk solution enables any Windows-based endpoint device to be repurposed into a centrally managed, secure, Windows-based thin client. For end users, it delivers an intuitive and familiar-looking user interface with a secure workspace environment that it can access remote or local resources from. It's an ideal solution for migrating to VDI, as you can continue to use local apps and resources while maintaining security. This also means that you won't be held back when moving to VDI due to the apps not working in virtual environments and newer operating systems. When it comes to security, ThinScale's Secure Remote Worker solution allows an end user to launch an app that is essentially a temporary, secure, workspace environment that runs on any Windows device and is designed to allow home and remote workers to use their own devices:</p>

<p>There are other solutions on the market that deliver this repurposing approach, but by using a Linux-based OS, these can add additional costs of management, and don't always offer the best levels of compatibility and functionality.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Accessing the desktop using a browser</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>In the previous sections, we talked about either using a software-based or hardware-based client to access our virtual desktop, but there is also a third method: using an HTML5-enabled browser on any device. The key use case for using this method is when installing client software on an endpoint device is not possible. For example, you might have a bring-your-own-device policy where end users don't want to install client software, or you might want to use a public-facing endpoint in a hotel lobby where the device is locked down and you cannot install the client software.</span></p>
<p>This is where this use case comes in, allowing you to access your virtual desktop machine using an HTML5-enabled web browser, which also requires no additional plugins or software to be downloaded and installed. The HTML desktop access is what is referred to as the VMware Blast protocol.</p>
<p>To connect to your virtual desktop machine or View-hosted application using the browser, open the browser, and in the address bar, type the address of your Connection Server.</p>
<p>In the example lab, the address is <kbd>https://hzn7-cs1.pvolab.com</kbd>.</p>
<p>Before you access your virtual desktop machine, you will first see a web page that displays two different options. You have the choice of downloading the full version of the Horizon Client or you can continue and connect via HTML, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/da603ac1-31cc-4ad2-9d36-9cff0973c061.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Click on the link for <span class="packt_screen">VMware Horizon HTML Access</span> from the left-hand side of the screen. You will now see the login box, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9870491f-d317-4706-9f5c-796105e2ae32.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Type in the username and password, and then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Login</span> button.</p>
<p>You will now see the resources that the user is entitled to. In this example, a Windows 7 Dedicated desktop pool, along with Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, are delivered as Horizon published applications. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b6cee937-f85e-4a51-824e-19ef972661a2.png"/></div>
<p>You can now click on the resource you want to run, which will then launch inside the browser.</p>
<p>With the latest version of the Client (version 4.10), there are a number of new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-screen mode support</strong>: You can now display a remote desktop or published application in full-screen mode.</li>
<li><strong>Support for multi-session modes</strong>: When a multi-session mode is enabled for a published app, you can use multiple sessions of the same published app when you log on to the same server and app but from a different client device.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced copy and paste feature</strong>: If you are using a Chrome or Firefox browser, you can now copy and paste directly from your local client system to a remote desktop or published application. Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, or Safari browser users must continue to use the copy and paste window.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span>For more information about the features in the latest Horizon Chrome OS Client, you can read the release notes at the following link:</span> <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-HTML-Access/4.10/rn/horizon-html-access-410-release-notes.html">https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-HTML-Access/4.10/rn/horizon-html-access-410-release-notes.html</a>.</p>
<p>To use the HTML access feature, you need to run a supported browser. The browsers that are currently supported are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome 69, 70</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 11</li>
<li>Safari 12</li>
<li>Firefox 62, 63</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge 42, 44</li>
</ul>
<div class="NormalPACKT packt_tip"><span>You also need to make sure that you have enabled the desktop pool for HTML access and that you have the remote experience agent installed on the virtual desktop. Otherwise, you will not be able to access desktops or apps using the browser.</span></div>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>We have explored the various options for how an end user can connect to their virtual desktops and Horizon published applications.</span></p>
