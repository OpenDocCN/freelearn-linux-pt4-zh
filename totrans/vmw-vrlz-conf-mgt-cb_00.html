It helps you patch your machines with the latest patches released by OS vendors and automate software provisioning. You can see your compliance score on the vROps console after integrating both of them.</p><p>This book provides recipes for installing VCM and then the initial configuration, moving ahead with integration to another VMware tool. After this, it continues with configuring compliance and patching for Linux and Windows machines. We have a chapter that will help you configure VCM in order to deploy software from VCM.</p><p>You can use this book as a guide to completely explore all the features of VCM, and in the troubleshooting section, you can take a look at the issues you might face while working on VCM every day.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec2"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Installing VCM">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Installing VCM</em></span>, discusses the components of vRealize Configuration Manager (VCM), various options to install VCM; including the prerequisites; and ends with fine-tuning the database server used by VCM.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Configuring VCM to Manage Your Infrastructure">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Configuring  VCM to Manage Your Infrastructure</em></span>, discusses more about VCM configuration, and we start adding virtual infrastructure elements, installing agents, and configuring discovery.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Linux Patching">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux Patching</em></span>, shows you how to install the Software Content Repository (SCR), used to download and distribute patches, then follows all the steps required to configure, and distribute patches to managed Linux/Unix servers.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Windows Patching">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows Patching</em></span>, shows you how to configure VCM to synchronize patches with Microsoft servers, check the status of managed Windows machines, and finally install patches on demand or on schedule.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Software Provisioning for Windows">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Software Provisioning for Windows</em></span>, discusses how VCM can be used to distribute software on managed Windows machines; whether servers or desktops, the process will be the same.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Compliance Management">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Compliance Management</em></span>, teaches you how to import and export compliance configurations, create compliance rules for Windows and Unix/Linux, and perform virtualization.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Maintenance of VCM">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Maintenance of VCM</em></span>, discusses how to upgrade VCM, make changes in Service accounts, upgrade agents after the VCM upgrade, decommission managed machines, and offers some naming conventions to use.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Integration with vROps and Scheduling">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Integration with vROps and Scheduling</em></span>, gives us more details of integrating VCM with vROps, and then using the scheduling feature of VCM to schedule reports, compliance, data collection, and so on.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Troubleshooting VCM">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Troubleshooting VCM</em></span>, is the final chapter and discuss various issues to troubleshoot in VCM, such as agent communication and agent upgrades.

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec3"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>If you are planning to go along with your practices as per the recipes in the book, which is highly recommended, you will need a good lab  to work in. As VCM works with multiple VMware components, and you will want to test integration as well, then you will need a machine with at least 32 GB of RAM, supported by a minimum of a quad-core processor, 1 TB HDD, and 256 GB SSD. You can install your favorite OS and on top of it either VMware Workstation or Virtual box. You need to create a small lab that will include a Windows Domain controller, and a few Windows servers hosting SQL, vCenter, VCM, and so on. You can install other components such as vCloud Director, vROps, and vCNS. Sometimes, 32 GB of RAM may not be sufficient, so power on only those VMs that you will need. Basic functionalities can be tested with a portable lab on your laptop with 16 GB RAM, which excludes vCD, vROps, and VCNS.</p><p>Here are the specs for my lab:</p><p>Lab 01: This is a desktop I have at home with 32 GB DDR3 RAM, AMD FX6300 6 core processor, 256 GB SSD, and 1 TB HDD</p><p>Lab 02: This is my portable lab on my laptop with 16 GB DDR3 RAM, Intel i5 quad-core processor, and 256 GB HDD</p></div>
