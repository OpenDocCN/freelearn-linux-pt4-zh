    the composite desktop model, allowing all the component parts of the desktop,
    **operating system** (**OS**), apps, user profiles, and data to be abstracted,
    managed, and delivered back to end users on demand. This allows you to deliver
    a truly stateless desktop environment.

    control end users' mobile devices and cloud-hosted virtual desktops and applications
    from the cloud or from an on-premises deployment. It allows end users to access
    their corporate resources securely using smartphones, tablets, PCs, and laptops

    or mobile. End users can also access their virtual desktop machines from here.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The App Volumes solution came from an acquisition that VMware made in August
    2014, when they acquired a startup company called CloudVolumes. The original CloudVolumes
    solution delivered a real-time application delivery engine for virtual and physical
    desktop environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In December 2014, CloudVolumes was rebranded and became what we now know as
    App Volumes, and was offered as part of the Horizon Enterprise edition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what does App Volumes give you? At a high-level, App Volumes provides real-time
    application delivery and life cycle management solution that is used to deliver
    applications that you capture using the App Volumes provisioning process. The
    captured applications are then layered into the OS of your virtual and physical
    desktops. In a nutshell, App Volumes is an application layering solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But how is this different to the way a virtual desktop environment and app delivery
    works today? Even though in VDI, the desktop OS has been abstracted from the underlying
    hardware, the apps still remain tightly integrated into the OS. As we have already
    discussed this in [Chapter 1](6b70801c-f579-4fd6-8910-1cc57a06831e.xhtml), *Introducing
    VDI and VMware Horizon 7*, the ideal virtual desktop solution is to be able to
    deliver fully stateless desktops and have the elements of what makes up the full
    end user experience added on the fly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having a fully stateless desktop model provides the most cost-effective solution
    by making it easier to manage each component individually and also requires less
    infrastructure. Today, there are a number of tools that can take care of delivering
    the user personalization, user data, and user profile elements to the desktop,
    such as Liquidware ProfileUnity. However, apps are still delivered as part of
    the base OS image, or are delivered using an app publishing solution where the
    apps are actually running on a server in the datacenter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'App Volumes provides a layer of abstraction between the OS and the applications
    by delivering the applications in separate containers. These containers are called
    **AppStacks**, and integrate seamlessly by effectively layering the applications
    into the OS of the virtual desktop machine. The following diagram shows a comparison
    between the traditionally installed model versus the **App Volumes Agent** layered
    approach:'

    end user with their own container or virtual hard disk where they can install
    their own applications. This container is called a **Writable Volume**, and follows
    the end user when they log in to different virtual desktop machines, bringing
    all of their applications with them.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, how does App Volumes work? The first thing you must do is create or capture
    an application that can be delivered by App Volumes. You start this process by
    installing the application on a virtual desktop machine, which is referred to
    as the provisioning machine. This provisioning machine is basically a vanilla
    installation of the OS, with no applications installed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you start the capture process, an empty VMDK file (App Volumes also supports
    VHD), called an AppStack, is mounted on the provisioning machine. Next, you start
    the application installation as you would do normally. All of the files associated
    with this application are then redirected to the AppStack or VMDK file.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Once you have completed the capture process, the AppStack is set to read-only
    and is ready to be assigned to end users based on their Active Directory group
    membership. AppStacks can also be assigned to individual users or other groups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does App Volumes work? Step 2 – app delivery
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have your AppStacks created, you can now deliver them to the end users.
    AppStacks are assigned based on Active Directory membership. An **App Volumes
    Agent** runs on their virtual desktop machine and mounts the virtual hard disk
    that contains the captured application. The agent "layers" in the applications
    files and settings, making the application appear as if it were fully integrated
    and installed locally, rather than running it from an additional drive. This is
    how applications are able to be delivered to a user in real-time, since **AppStack**
    can be assigned on the fly based on AD membership.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: When an **AppStack** is unassigned from an end user, the virtual hard drive
    is simply unmounted, taking with it all of the application's files and settings,
    making the OS appear as though the application was never actually there!
  prefs: []

    and in the case of JMP, delivers applications on demand as desktops are built
    and delivered to the end users.
