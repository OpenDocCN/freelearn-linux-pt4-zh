<p>When something is virtual, it's real, but not really. Virtual computers exist inside an actual physical, reach-out-and-touch-it computer. Okay, it's not really real, but it's inside a computer? Yes, you've got it! However, just to clarify for our mutual understanding, Merriam Webster's dictionary defines virtual (in the context of computing) as <em>being on or simulated on a computer or computer network</em>. This is a very good definition in that it describes exactly how a virtual device comes to be and where it exists.</p>
<p>A virtualized network environment provides an organization with the capability to create multiple <strong>virtual machines</strong> (<strong>VMs</strong>), each running a different operating system and applications. This allows the organization to maximize the capacity of its IT resources by extending the capabilities of a single computer to provide direct computing capacity to several users simultaneously.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will look at the concepts and applications of virtualization in a computer network environment. This includes the terminology, topology, components (virtual and physical), and their configurations and purposes. With the understanding of these elements of a virtualized environment, we can then see the purpose and operation of a virtualized network. The specific areas we will discuss are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual environments</li>
<li>Hypervisors and virtual network managers</li>
<li>Virtual hosts and guests</li>
<li>Hardware configurations for a virtual environment</li>
<li>Resource allocations in a virtual network</li>
</ul>

<p>There are three types of virtualization that are used in networks, each with its own specific purpose and operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual private network (VPN)</strong>: A secure connection through the internet using tunneling protocols</li>
<li><strong>Virtual local area network (VLAN)</strong>: A grouping of network nodes in a logical domain</li>
<li><strong>Virtual network</strong>: Not to be confused with a VLAN, a virtual network employs virtual, software-induced components to extend the capabilities of physical computing equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>A VPN creates a virtualized direct connection over the internetwork, between a remote device and an internal network. The purpose of a VPN is to provide the same safeguards and security that a directly wired connection should provide. A VLAN creates a logical arrangement of network nodes, regardless of their proximity, into a single domain structure. A VLAN is a virtual subset of a network that is a collision domain. Don't confuse a VLAN with a subnetwork, though.</p>

<p>The essential parts of a virtualized network environment, as illustrated in the following diagram, are the physical hardware, a virtual network server, and one or more virtual machines, each running a guest operating system, which, in turn, supports applications running in the virtual space.</p>
<p>Underneath any virtual environment is a physical infrastructure that must be able to support the resource needs of the virtualized environment you envision. As we discuss the components of a virtual environment, bear in mind the importance of the physical hardware:</p>

<p>Regardless of whether a network is physical or virtual, it requires the functionality of interconnecting network devices, such as switches, routers, and network interfaces. A virtual network differs from a physical network because many, if not all, of its connectivity devices are themselves virtualized versions of physical devices with the same functionality.</p>
<p>In a virtual network, the essential virtual devices are virtual servers, virtual machines, virtual network interfaces, virtual switches, and virtual routers. Any physical component required in a physical network has a virtual equivalent use in a virtual environment.</p>

<p>Networks grow, adding nodes, applications, and scope. In the past, managing network growth meant adding one or more physical servers to handle the additional demand on existing servers. Adding a physical server can be costly in terms of hardware acquisition, configuration, and downtime. On the other hand, adding a virtual server requires only the time to configure it, resulting in a much lower implementation cost and a lot less service interruption.</p>
<p>Server virtualization is the partitioning of a physical server into two or more virtual servers. Server virtualization masks the physical hardware and users see only the resources that have been allocated to the virtual machine in use. There are three primary types of server virtualization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full virtualization</strong>: This form of server virtualization replaces the physical server's operating system with a specialized form of operations, either through a supervisor or a hypervisor. The hypervisor acts as a go-between for the virtual servers and virtual machines, which are unaware of each other, running in its environment and the physical computer and its resources. Examples of full virtualization systems include Adeos, Mac-on-Linux, Parallel Desktop for Mac, VMware ESXi, VirtualBox, Win4BSD, and <strong>Quick Emulator</strong> (<strong>QEMU</strong>) or Microsoft Hyper-V.</li>
<li><strong>Para-virtualization</strong>: In this form of server virtualization, a hypervisor or <strong>virtual machine manager</strong> (<strong>VMM</strong>) supports virtual servers that have been modified to run in this environment. This virtualization approach allows two or more different operating systems to share a physical computer and its resources. A primary example of this form of virtualization is the Xen Project Hypervisor.</li>
<li><strong>Operating system level virtualization</strong>: This form of server virtualization creates an environment in which several processing spaces, known as containers, zones, virtualization engines, or jails, which are independent processing spaces, are all running on the same operating system. In place of a hypervisor, the native operating system provides support for the virtualized environment. Examples of this type of server virtualization include Linux V-Server, FreeBSD Jail, AIX Workload Partitions, and Solaris Containers.</li>
</ul>

<p>A key part of virtualization is the hypervisor, or VMM, which is low-level software that facilitates multiple virtual machines running on a single physical computer. There are two types of hypervisors, plus a hybrid that blends the two. The two types of hypervisors are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type I</strong>: These are the bare-metal, embedded, or native hypervisors. This type of hypervisor installs itself directly onto the physical hardware or on the <em>bare metal</em> of the computer, as illustrated in the following diagram.</li>
<li><strong>Type II</strong>: These are the hosted hypervisors. As shown in the following diagram, a Type II hypervisor runs on the host computer's operating system:</li>
</ul>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">A Type I hypervisor configuration (left) and a Type II hypervisor configuration (right)</div>
<p>As illustrated in the preceding diagram, the primary difference between a Type I and a Type II hypervisor is that one runs without an underlying host operating system (Type I) while the other does (Type II).</p>
<p>Although not technically a separate category of hypervisors, some companies are finding that fitting different hypervisors to different workloads creates a more efficient computing solution for them. Third-party software is available to manage multi-hypervisor environments, creating a hybrid hypervisor deployment.</p>

<p>Three virtualization terms that are often confused or used interchangeably are virtual machine, host, and guest. A virtual machine and a guest are terms for the same thing. Each refers to a software-created and managed workspace on the host computer that emulates a single virtual computer. The term <em>host</em> can refer to the host hardware, or the computer on which the virtual system is running, or to the host OS in a Type II environment. The host system is typically able to support multiple guest systems.</p>

<p>A VM is a complete computer system, including its devices, operating system, application software, and so on, that are created through software to run on a physical computer, possibly along with other VMs. A VM is able to run programs or applications in the same way they would on a physical computer that's not been configured virtually:</p>

<p>A <strong>virtual machine management interface</strong> (<strong>VMMI</strong>), that is, a VM control panel, allows an administrator to monitor, create, delete, pause, start, and stop virtual machines in a virtualized environment. Some of these tools also provide the capability to reconfigure the allocation of the host system's physical resources for one or more virtual machines. Each of the major virtualized system developers (Citrix, Microsoft, and VMWare) offer VMMI software as part of their server virtualization packages. There are also third-party and open source VMMI packages that are compatible with many of the virtualization systems, including some that are based on the <strong>Simple Network Management Protocol</strong> (<strong>SNMP</strong>).</p>

<p>The hardware configuration required to support a virtual server, virtual machine, or other virtual devices is a function of each network environment, which is, in turn, a function of each individual organization. The major virtualization software providers have websites that enable users to determine the best hardware configuration for their needs, hardware, and plans. However, there are general guidelines, although not actually standards, for configuring a computer to support a virtual environment. The primary components for consideration are the CPU, memory, the BIOS/UEFI, and the physical network capacity.</p>
<p>Like just about everything else in computing, what you need in terms of computing power and memory really depends on what you plan to do. Your choices may depend on the answers to the questions that define the needs of your organization and its near-term requirements. Some of the considerations to address include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Along with primary memory, one or more processors sufficient in size to support the size and volume of the virtualized system are required:
<ul>
<li>If multiple physical computers are in the virtualized network, you should use the same CPU platform (Intel versus AMD) in every case. Virtual machines can move from one physical computer to another easily, but only if the computers have the same CPU platform.</li>
<li>Choose only those processors that are optimized for hardware virtualization support and include Intel-VT or AMD-V.</li>
<li>Multi-core processors can provide additional processing capabilities, especially in larger virtualizations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>: The number of virtual machines possible on a host computer is a function of the amount of memory available on the host. Memory is the most limiting resource in a virtualized environment.</li>
<li><strong>BIOS/UEFI</strong>: On AMD processors with AMD-V, this feature is automatically enabled. However, on Intel processors, the Intel-VT feature has an initial state disabled and must be enabled using either BIOS or UEFI.</li>
<li><strong>Physical network</strong>: Regardless of the structure of a virtualized of <strong>software-defined network</strong> (<strong>SDN</strong>) that overlays the physical network hardware, the physical network carries the network traffic. The physical network requires sufficient capacity to support all of the traffic generated by the virtual servers and machines, as if it were all directly part of the physical network.  </li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Virtual resource allocation</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In a virtualized environment, resources, such as the CPU, memory, and data storage, are allocated based on the settings of the shares, reservations, and limits of each resource for each VM. A virtual data center manages the resource pool and provides each VM with its initial resource allotment and on-demand resources, as needed, until the allocations reach an upper limit. The resource pool consists of the physical resources of the host computer minus the resource needs of the operating system, if any, and the hypervisor.</p>
<p>When the physical resources of the host no longer satisfy the resource demands of its virtual machines, the resources may require allocation or limits. The actions an administrator can take to assign resources to one or all VMs include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a reservation of one or more physical resources of the host computer or server cluster to one or more VMs</li>
<li>Allocate a fixed share of a physical resource to a VM</li>
<li>Assign a priority ranking to a VM that assures it a larger share of a physical resource</li>
<li>Set upper limits on the allocation of resources to a VM</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary allocation methods that are used to balance the assignment and use of the physical system resources to virtual machines are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource allocation shares</strong>: A share indicates the priority or importance of a virtual machine with respect to a particular resource. Shares are in three levels—<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Normal</strong>, or <strong>Low</strong>, which translates to <em>4</em> shares for High, <em>2</em> shares for Normal, and <em>1</em> share for Low. An administrator may also set a custom level and set the number of shares to a specific number that set a proportional share ratio with the shares of other VMs.</li>
<li><strong>Resource allocation reservation</strong>: A resource reservation sets a minimum amount (in MBs or MHz) of a physical resource allocated to a VM. If the amount of a reserved resource is not available, the VM will start with a lower share, until such a time as the rest of the reserved resources become available.</li>
<li><strong>Resource allocation limit</strong>: An allocation limit sets an upper limit on the amount of a physical resource that may be allocated to a virtual machine. A virtual server can allocate more than one resource allocation reservation amount, but with an allocation limit specified, it cannot allocate the resource above the limit (expressed as MBs, MHz, or IOPS). By default, the limits for CPU, memory, and data storage are unlimited.</li>
</ul>

<p>Network connectivity and bandwidth are host resources that may be allocated to the VMs running on it. The amount of allocation can be preset, just like the preceding resources, or it can be allocated to fit the communication need of a particular transmission.</p>
<p>A network connection on a VM can have one of three configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct access (bridged)</strong>: A VM, which has an assigned IP address, has direct access to an external network. The VM is able to communicate with the physical network through the host computer's network adapter and directly interact with network nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong>: In this configuration, the VM communicates to the network using the IP address of the host computer. This option is best if the VM doesn't have an IP address of its own.</li>
<li><strong>Host-only</strong>: This configuration creates a connection between the host computer's network adapter and that of the VM. In other words, the virtual network adapter is visible to the host system. In this configuration, the VM is able to communicate only with the host and any other VMs running on the host.</li>

<p>A virtual network uses essentially the same interconnection devices as a physical network—a <strong>network interface controller</strong> (<strong>NIC</strong>), a network switch, and a network router. On a virtual network, these devices (and a few others) are software-defined and virtual. These are <strong>virtual NICs</strong> (<strong>vNICs</strong>), <strong>virtual switches</strong> (<strong>vSwitches</strong>), and <strong>virtual routers</strong> (<strong>vRouters</strong>). The VMs connect to a virtual network through their vNICs, which logically connected to the <strong>physical NICs</strong> (<strong>pNICs</strong>) of the host.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>On many virtual networks, vNICs connect to a vSwitch, which, in turn, connect to a vRouter. The functions of these virtual connectivity devices mirror that of their physical counterparts. However, like all virtual devices, at some point, they interconnect with the physical network.  </p>

<p>There are three types of virtualization that are used in networks, each with its own specific purpose and operation—VPNs, VLANs, and virtual networks. The parts of a virtualized network environment are the physical hardware, a virtual network server, and virtual machines. In a virtual network, the devices are virtual servers, VMs, virtual network interfaces, virtual switches, and virtual routers. Server virtualization partitions a physical server into virtual servers. Three types of server virtualization are full virtualization, para-virtualization, and operating system level virtualization.</p>
<p>A hypervisor is a piece of software that facilitates multiple virtual machines running on a single physical computer. There are two types of hypervisors—Type I, or bare-metal, and Type II, or a hosted hypervisor. The difference between Type I and Type II hypervisors is that a Type I runs without an underlying host operating system and a Type II hypervisor runs on top of a host operating system.</p>
<p>A VM is a software-created and managed workspace on a host computer that emulates a single virtual computer. A host may refer to the physical hardware of a computer or a host OS in a Type II environment. A host system typically supports multiple guest (virtual) systems. A VM is a complete computer system that runs on a host computer, typically with other VMs.</p>
<p>The hardware configuration required for the configuration of a virtual environment is the CPU, with hardware virtualization, memory, the BIOS/UEFI, and the physical network. Resources are allocated through shares, reservations, and limits. Network connectivity and bandwidth are host resources that may be allocated as direct-access, NAT, and host-only.</p>
