<p><span>In order for networked devices to communicate with each other, some form of communication medium must be in place. This medium, regardless of type or technology, provides the conduit through which the transmitted signal travels from one node to another.</span></p>
<p><span>The technology used for wired and wireless network communication, beyond the physical medium involved, is not all that different.</span></p>
<p><span>The Server+ certification exam includes questions on the different connection media, their connectors, and proper installation procedures.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll look at the physical media that connects wired networks, and the <strong>radio frequency</strong> (<strong>RF</strong>) signals that connect wireless networks, local or wide in scope. We'll review the materials, construction, connections, installation, and technology that provide the communication connections linking a network to a network server.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The construction, connectors, and use of copper twisted-pair and coaxial cabling</li>
<li>The construction, connectors, and use of fiber-optic cabling</li>
<li>Cable installation methods and management devices</li>
<li>Network cabling labeling</li>

<p>Copper cables, in their various forms, have been the de facto standard for interconnecting network devices since the beginning of business-related computing (perhaps even longer, if we count the cabling systems of telephone service providers).</p>
<p>Copper cabling was an almost intuitive choice in early networks, which were mostly peer-to-peer topologies. It's relatively inexpensive, readily available, easily installed, and has low resistance to transmitted electrical signals. On the other hand, it has a limited transmission range and is susceptible to external electrical interference or noise.</p>
<p>When properly installed, copper cabling is both reliable and easy to maintain.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The copper cabling used in <strong>local area networks</strong> (<strong>LANs</strong>) is predominantly twisted-pair wire bundles.</p>
<p>One important point to know is that, even with insulation coating it, <strong>twisted-pair</strong> (<strong>TP</strong>) wiring is an <strong>electro-magnetic interference</strong> (<strong>EMI</strong>) sponge. Back in the late 1880s, the telephone people discovered that wrapping or twisting two wire strands together helped to reduce the amount of noise the wires absorbed from outside the cable. However, twisting wire pairs only reduces how susceptible TP is to electrical noise.</p>
<p>There are two types (and myriad variations) of twisted-pair copper cabling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)</strong>: Unshielded doesn't mean bare wire; what it does mean is that beyond the insulation around each wire strand, there is no other shielding in the cable to block EMI. UTP is inexpensive compared to other options, and in <span>typically safe environments such as </span>residential properties and small offices, its low cost more than compensates for its faults.</li>
<li><strong>Shielded twisted-pair (STP)</strong>: Shielded means that, in addition to the insulation of each wire, shielding such as metal foil or braided mesh surrounds the internal cable construction to deflect or absorb interference.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following image shows the physical differences between UTP and STP. Notice the lack of shielding on the UTP, and the plethora of shielding on the STP:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1028 image-border" src="Images/2564d2c8-6ecb-4f2f-8d6a-b8431759aa9b.jpg" style="width:36.92em;height:31.00em;" width="798" height="669"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">UTP versus STP copper cabling</div>
<p>Each segment of cable installed on a network has one or more specifications, standards, or configurations. In addition, a number of the various cable configurations have a special purpose that not only dictates the pattern and position of the individual wires, but also how they connect to a jack.</p>
<p>The termination and pinouts of twisted-pair cabling are governed by <strong>Electronics Industry Association</strong> (<strong>EIA</strong>)/<strong>Telecommunications Industry Association</strong> (<strong>TIA</strong>) standards 568A and 568B. Often, people refer to the two standards as being commercial and residential, respectively.</p>
<p>In any wired network, several different types of cables, meaning cables with different connector configurations, connect the various elements and devices of the network. The cable types you may encounter in the Server+ exam are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crossover cables</strong>: These combine the two 568 standards, with a connection of each standard on either end. This cable type typically connects two communication devices of the same type, such as two routers or two switches. A crossover cable has wires 1 and 3 switched with one another, and wires 2 and 6 switched with one another, at one end of the cable. The following diagram illustrates this configuration:</li>
</ul>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The pinouts of straight-through and crossover cables</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch cables</strong>: This is a generic term that describes any cable type, including crossover, rollover, and straight-through cables, used to establish a connection between two electronic devices.</li>
<li><strong>Rollover cables</strong>: These are also known as <strong>Yost cables</strong>, these have reversed or rolled-over pinouts, and aren't used for data transfer but rather for creating an interface between two devices. The pinouts for this cable type are listed in the following table:</li>

<li><strong>Straight-through cables</strong>: These have connections of the same standard, 568a or 568b, on both ends, with the connector pins matched<span>—that is to say,</span> pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, and so on.

<p>Coaxial cables have two channels<span>—t</span>he core wire and the metallic, usually copper, mesh layer, which each carry the same signal. <span>The electrically-charged carriers each generate an electromagnetic field that</span> cancels the other channel's emission, creating a barrier that external interference is unable to penetrate to alter the transmitt<span>ed signal.</span></p>

<p><span>Along with wire patterns and pinouts, t</span>he connectors that terminate network cables are standards-defined. For use with twisted-pair cabling, the EIA/TIA 568 standards govern the <strong>registered jack-45</strong> (<strong>RJ-45</strong>) connector, which is an <strong>eight position/eight contact</strong> (<strong>8P8C</strong>) connector, as shown in the following image:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1031 image-border" src="Images/0e3e29e4-2d29-47c1-814f-2dda88e20d44.jpg" style="width:23.42em;height:20.92em;" width="812" height="727"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">An 8P8C connector (RJ-45)</div>
<p><span>This connector is the standard for network cable connections to wall jacks, patch panels, and other n</span><span>etworking devices. A smaller version of the RJ-45 is the RJ-11, which is a four-wire connector primarily used for telephone connections.</span></p>
<p>Network coaxial cables use one of two different styles of connectors. The most common coaxial connector is the F-type. This is familiar to most people, as it is the one that connects their television service to a cable provider. It also connects coaxial network cabling to a network adapter.</p>
<p>Another commonly used coaxial connector on data networks is the <strong>Bayonet Neill-Concelman</strong> (<strong>BNC</strong>) connector. Which of the two is a better connector for computer networks is a matter of choice<span>—b</span>oth have advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>The EIA/TIA 568 cabling standards also define standards for placement, distance, and use, related to where the cables are installed. These standards include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backbone cable</strong>: This is the primary communication cabling that interconnects the primary, main, and intermediate distribution facilities (telecommunication and equipment rooms) in a facility or campus. Twisted-pair cables installed between network connections can be no more than 90 meters in length (about 300 feet).</li>
<li><strong>Entrance facility</strong>: Otherwise known as the demarcation point, or <em>demark</em>. This is the location where a service provider's network and the subscriber's backbone interconnect. The demark point should be at least 12 inches from where the service line enters the facility.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-connect</strong>: The 568 standard requires an equipment room that provides for the termination of the network backbone, as well as a cross-connection point for a facility's entire network.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal cable</strong>: This connects the networking devices on a single level of a facility, such as a floor or story, to the facility's backbone. This cable terminates at an <strong>intermediate distribution facility</strong> (<strong>IDF</strong>) or telecommunication closet a level. The standard sets a maximum distance of 90 meters between the IDF and a connection point. However, a patch cable of no more than six meters (approximately 20 feet) can connect a network device to the connection point at each end of the horizontal cabling. The interconnecting patch cables cannot exceed a total of 10 meters together.</li>
<li><strong>Telecommunication rooms/IDF</strong>: Telecommunication rooms, or <em>closets</em>, provide an unlimited number of interconnections between horizontal cabling segments on one level of a facility.</li>
<li><strong>Work areas</strong>: The 568 standard requires that each workstation or network node location has access to two network connections, one for voice and one for data—each directly connected by the horizontal wiring to an IDF or telecommunication closet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cable standards also classify network twisted-pair cables into <strong>categories</strong> (<strong>CATs</strong>). <span>This mostly relates to Ethernet cabling, but has expanded to other types of network applications. </span>Each CAT defines an evolutionary step in network cable capabilities, based on its frequency range, bandwidth, and <strong>data transfer rates</strong> (<strong>DTRs</strong>). </p>
<p>Currently, the standards define seven categories, plus a few sub-categories. However, CATs 1 and 2 aren't network cable categories, CAT 4 is specific to ring topologies, and CAT 7 is still in development. Therefore, the only Ethernet cable categories you need to know about are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Category 3 (CAT 3) cable</strong>: An eight-wire (four pairs) UTP cable, capable of 10 Mbps DTR and 16 MHz bandwidth. It is <span>otherwise known as station wire. </span>CAT 3 is still usable for older Ethernet networks, but is now obsolete, replaced by CAT 5 and later categories.</li>
<li><strong>Category 5 (CAT 5) cable</strong>: An <span>eight-wire (four pairs)</span> UTP cable that supports both 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps data speeds, and bandwidth of 100 MHz on an Ethernet network. It also supports voice and video transmissions. CAT 5 is still in use, but the CAT 5e standard superseded it.</li>
<li><strong>Category 5 enhanced (CAT 5e) cable</strong>: This upgrade to the CAT 5 standard reduced channel crosstalk, and extended its data speed to 1 Gbps with 100 MHz bandwidth. CATs 5 and 5e both use 24–26 AWG copper wire. CAT 5e cabling is backward-compatible with CAT 5.</li>
<li><strong>Category 6 (CAT 6) cable</strong>: This CAT raised bandwidth to 250 MHz with GB Ethernet speeds. It also provides for a better outer jacket and insulation, has thinner core copper wires (22–24 AWG), improved <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong> (<strong>SNR</strong>), and is less susceptible to EMI. CAT 6 specifies both UTP and STP, and is backward-compatible with CATs 5 and 5e.</li>
<li><strong>Category 6 augmented (CAT 6a) cable</strong>: This<span> upgrade to </span>the CAT 6 standard raises the DTR to 10 Gbps and the bandwidth to 500 MHz. CAT 6a cables are STP, and require special connectors that provide grounding to the cable.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as the category cable standards discussed in the previous section, IEEE 802.3 specifies additional cable standards. These overlap the category cable standards, but also provide a self-describing acronym to each cable type that makes it easier to know its capabilities.</p>
<p>The naming convention for cabling in the IEEE Ethernet standard consists of three primary parts: <strong>DTR</strong>, <strong>signaling mode</strong>, and <strong>cable identification</strong>. For example, 10BaseT represents a 10 Mbps, <strong>baseband</strong> (<strong>Base</strong>), twisted-pair (<strong>T</strong>) cable.</p>
<p>The IEEE Ethernet cable standards specify the following cable types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10Base2</strong>: A legacy standard that is still in use. It represents a 10 Mbps, baseband coaxial cable with an attenuation distance of 185 meters (about 607 feet), or a close approximation of its effective range as a multiple of 100 meters. 10Base2 is also known as <strong>Thinnet</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>10Base5</strong>: Another coaxial cable with a speed of 10 Mbps on baseband signaling over a distance of 500 meters. Like 10Base2, 5 represents the range as a multiple of 100 meters. 10Base5 is also known as <strong>Thicknet</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>10BaseT</strong>: A 10 Mbps baseband UTP or STP cable. CATs 3 and higher support 10BaseT. All twisted-pair cabling has a standard range or attenuation distance of 90 meters.</li>
<li><strong>10Base-FL</strong>: A 10 Mbps baseband standard that runs on a <strong>fiber-optic link</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>). Because of the fiber-optic medium, its range is 2 km.</li>
<li><strong>100BaseTX</strong>: A fast Ethernet specification with 100 Mbps baseband signaling on UTP cable, typically CAT 5 or above.</li>
<li><strong>100BaseT4</strong>: A specification that is essentially the same as 100BaseTX with STP cabling added.</li>
<li><strong>100BaseFX</strong>: A fiber-optic cable specification implemented on either <strong>single-mode</strong> or <strong>multi-mode</strong> cable. Its range varies with the specific medium. Single-mode fiber-optic cable has a range of 10,000 meters (a little over six miles), and multi-mode cable has a range of 412 meters (a bit less than a quarter of a mile).</li>
<li><strong>1000BaseT</strong>: A GB Ethernet standard, along with 1000BaseTX. Both run on CAT 5 or above UTP cable. However, with the increased speed, its range reduces to 75 meters (about 246 feet).</li>
<li><strong>1000BaseCX</strong>: Another GB Ethernet standard that runs on STP cabling with a range of only 25 meters (82 feet).</li>
<li><strong>1000BaseSX</strong>: A fiber-optic standard that transmits a short-wave laser stream on either 50 or 62.5-micron cable. On 50-micron filaments, its range is up to 550 meters (1850 feet); on 62.5-micron filaments, its range reduces to half that of the 50-micron cable. Both of these distances are full-duplex.</li>
<li><strong>1000BaseLX</strong>: Similar to the 1000BaseSX standard, but carrying long-wave laser streams to a distance of 5,000 meters (3.1 miles).</li>
<li><strong>10GbE</strong>: A standard that transmits at a speed of 10 Gbps or the equivalent of 10,000 Mbps. It uses the same medium specification as 1000BaseLX, but with technology that increases its range up to 40 km (a bit less than 25 miles).</li>

<p>Networks that require longer distances and higher bandwidth than copper cabling can provide are candidates for fiber-optic cabling. Fiber-optic cables have two advantages over copper twisted-pair cables: range and bandwidth.</p>
<p>The maximum range on fiber-optic lines is around 20 km, whereas the maximum range for copper twisted-pair cables is, by standard, 100 meters or less. Bandwidth is another area in which fiber-optic cable surpasses copper. There are fiber-optic cables with bandwidth ratings of up to 60 Tbps, but fiber-optic network cabling is generally in the 10 Gbps to 100 Gbps range. </p>

<li><strong>Cladding</strong><span>: T</span>his is typically a highly reflective material that coats the core filament. The effect of the cladding is very much like that of the backing material on a mirror, which reflects the light back toward its source. The purpose of the cladding is to keep the light streams within the core.</li>
<li><strong>Protective Layer (buffer)</strong>: Many fiber-optic strands and single filament lines have a protective coating around the cladding and core to provide protection against bending, which may break the core.</li>
<li><strong>Kevlar Layer</strong>: A strengthening Kevlar fabric layer encases the inner layer (core, cladding, and possibly buffer) to provide additional stiffening and strength to the cable, as a precaution against installation mishaps.</li>
<li><strong>Outer Jacket</strong>: An outer jacket or sheath protects the fiber-optic cable assembly from any nicks, cuts, or abrasions it may encounter during installation.</li>
</ul>

<p>An SM cable has a single fiber filament at its center, which carries a single transmission mode or light stream. Because its core is relatively small in diameter, only one signal mode is able to pass through it. This small core and the single light wave it carries combine to eliminate problems with the transmitted light pulses.</p>
<p>SM has a higher bandwidth than multi-mode cable, and has an attenuation point that is up to 50 times farther. However, you do have to pay more for this speed and distance. SM fiber-optics is also known as SM optical waveguide.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, MM fiber is capable of transmitting several light streams at once. MM fiber provides higher bandwidth and higher speeds, but only medium-length distances.</p>
<p>In contrast to single mode, MM disperses light waves into multiple modes, or paths, for transmission. Whereas SM is able to carry a single light wave over longer distances, MM light streams can distort over longer distances, which limits its distance.</p>
<p>The two cable modes are shown in the following diagram:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Single mode transmits a single light stream; multi-mode carries multiple light streams</div>
<p>Which cable is best to use for any particular network depends on, first of all, budget, followed closely by transmission distance, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the transmission distance is less than 100 meters and is indoors, use copper cable</li>
<li>For distances longer than 100 meters, but shorter than a couple of miles, MM is the sensible choice if you wish to avoid repeaters and such</li>
<li>If the distance is two miles or more, SM is best</li>

<p>Many different types of fiber-optic connector are available, each specialized to a particular use with a certain transmission mode. The connectors used in the deployment of a fiber-optic network will depend on cost, experience, and availability, among other factors.</p>
<p>Each connector has its own advantages and disadvantages. If the connectors used in a network are less than optimal, the performance of the network could degrade over time. The TIA defines fiber-optic cabling specifications in the <strong>Fiber Optic Cable Intermateability Standard</strong> (<strong>FOCIS</strong>), which defines both the plugs and sockets of the various connector standards.</p>

<p><span>Common fiber-optic connectors are shown in the following diagram:</span></p>

<p>The fiber-optic connectors you may encounter in the Server+ exam are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lucent Connector (LC)</strong>: The LC fiber-optic connector is smaller than most other connectors, but still includes a standard ceramic ferrule connector (the ferrule is the nozzle that protects the fiber in the connector body). FOCIS-10 defines standards for the LC connector.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Connector (SC)</strong>: This connects with a push-pull locking mechanism that features a spring-loaded ferrule. SC has been a dominant fiber-optic connector type over the past few years, along with the ST connector, because of its high performance. FOCIS-3 <span>defines standards for the</span> SC connector.</li>
<li><strong>Straight Tip (ST)</strong>: The ST connector is the most popular connector for MM fiber-optic cable. It's common in commercial fiber networks. FOCIS-2 <span>defines standards for the </span>ST connector.</li>
<li><strong>Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP)</strong>: The SFP interface specification defines a transceiver for connecting <strong>Fiber Channel</strong> (<strong>FC</strong>) and <strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong> (<strong>GbE</strong>) cabling to network switches and other internetworking devices using an LC connector. The <strong>Quad-SFP</strong> (<strong>QSFP</strong>) standard is a popular version of the SFP standard.</li>

<p>When installing physical network cable, whether twisted-pair, coaxial, or fiber-optic, there are considerations and practices that, if followed, can help to ensure an intact and fully functioning cable plant.</p>
<p>Each type of cable medium has its own special handling requirements and guidelines for proper installation. These address cabling issues that can occur because of improper installation, such as interference, cable damage, and signal loss. The following sections identify the considerations, practices, and guidelines for successfully installing each cable type.</p>
<p>There are certain installation guidelines specific to the copper twisted-pair and coaxial cabling, regarding cable placement, cable bundling, and cable suspension. Many of these same guidelines and recommendations also work for fiber-optic cable.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following steps, processes, procedures, and practices can help to avoid transmission problems on twisted-pair cabling:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install cable at a 90-degree angle (enter and exit perpendicularly) to any material it passes through, over, or under. If it's necessary to bend the cable, it's important not to exceed the cable's bend radius specification, which is 1 inch <span>according to the EIA/TIA 568b standard (</span>shown in the following diagram). Many certified installers use a 2-inch bend radius as best practice:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1036 image-border" src="Images/343dd3f6-3dc4-443a-9e36-f8c5ac6eef10.jpg" style="width:19.58em;height:18.67em;" width="804" height="768"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The standard bend radius for UTP/STP cable</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use predictable cable pathways, such as following hallways, major walls, and other substantial structural components. Avoid crossing over hallways and large office or living spaces, if possible.</li>
<li>Install cable in cable supports across open areas, such as basements, attics, and crawlspaces. Place hangers, hooks, and other cable supports every four to five feet across the open space. Tighten the cable run to remove any sag in the cable. A variety of cable supports are available, including the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cable ducts</strong>: Typically a wire raceway or trough that facilitates installation (pulling), organization, and redirection of multiple cables. Most cable duct systems have slots on the side-through which cables are rerouted to drops along the cable run. Caps and solid ducts are available for additional protection.</li>
<li><strong>Cable hangers</strong>: These enable the running of cable across an open space, or support cable in spaces where ducts or trays really won't work. Different styles of cable hangers include loops, saddles, bridle rings, and J-Hooks, all of which will support bare cable or conduits. Cable hangers also provide the flexibility to run cable vertically, horizontally, at the top of walls, from ceilings, and along virtually any other surface.</li>
<li><strong>Cable raceways</strong>: Any solid box-like rigid channel that is fully or partially closed and hides, secludes, or protects cabling is essentially a raceway. The different types of raceways include latching, J-Channel, J-Hook, corner duct, and power raceways.</li>
<li><strong>Cable sleeves</strong>: Many refer to cable sleeves and conduits interchangeably, but there are several other types of this support, including braided sleeving, spiral wrap, and wire loom. Wire loom and conduits surround cables and wires to protect against damage and weather. Braided sleeving, which can be metallic or made of carbon fiber, fiber glass, Kevlar, or several other materials, forms itself to its contents to provide protection.</li>
<li><strong>Cable ties</strong>: Otherwise known as <strong>zip ties</strong>, this cable support is actually more like a cable bundler as it wraps a group of cables reasonably tightly to hold the bundle as what amounts to one cable. Cable ties consist of a length of nylon, metal, or other materials, including fabric, and have a locking head that is able to hold in position by locking onto the ridges along the strip. Velcro cable ties are better in situations where they need to be reusable.</li>
<li><strong>Cable trays</strong>: This type of cable support is best for supporting large numbers of cables from the ceiling or below the floor. Their name comes from their open-channel shape, but they are also baskets, cable ladders, and trunking lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep cables relatively slack at each end, and as much as possible throughout the cable run. Avoid or eliminate any taps, splices, or repairs in a cable between the distribution facility and the wall plate to which a station will connect.</li>
<li>Keep cables at the following minimum safe distances:
<ul>
<li>3 inches from any electrical power line of 2 kVA or less</li>
<li>12 inches from other higher voltage sources, especially fluorescent lighting fixtures</li>
<li>3 feet from electrical lines of 5 kVA or more</li>
<li>3.5 feet away from any transformers or electrical motors, such as soft-drink machines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Label all cable runs at least at each end. Preferably, there should also be labeling on each cable run one or two places toward the middle of the cable pull.</li>
<li>Any cable installed in a duct or other space that is a part of a building's <strong>heating, ventilation, and air conditioning</strong> (<strong>HVAC</strong>) system, commonly in the ceiling or walls of a building, must be plenum-rated. Plenum-rated cabling has a fire-retardant coating, typically Teflon, which prevents the cable from giving off toxic gases and smoke as it burns.</li>
</ol>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this chapter, we began by looking at LAN cabling, which is predominantly TP wire. There are two types of TP: UTP and STP. The installation and configuration of network cables are in the EIA/TIA 568A/B standards. Cables installed between network connections can be no more than 90 meters in length (about 300 feet).</p>
<p>We then looked at different types of cables. A crossover cable connects devices of the same type. A patch cable is a generic term or any cable type used to connect two devices. A rollover cable has reversed pinouts and creates an interface between two dissimilar devices. Straight-through cables have the same pinout standard on their ends and connect a network adapter to a device, such as a router.</p>
<p>Twisted-pair cables use RJ-45 connectors, an 8P8C, for cable connections, wall jacks, patch panels, and others.</p>
<p><span>Coaxial cable has two channels: the core wire carries the transmitted signal and the metallic mesh carries the same signal. Each generates an electromagnetic field that cancels the other's emissions. Coaxial cables use F-type and BNC connectors.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, we discussed the EIA/TIA 568 cabling standards. </span>A backbone cable connects distribution facilities. An entrance facility is where a service provider's network and the subscriber's backbone interconnect. A horizontal cable connects network devices on a single level. IDF/telecommunication rooms provide for interconnections between horizontal cabling segments.</p>
<p>We then looked at category cabling, which defines Ethernet twisted-pair cabling. CAT 3 is a four-pair UTP cable capable of 10 Mbps and 16 MHz bandwidth. CAT 5 is a four-pair UTP cable supporting 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps and 100 MHz. CAT 5e reduces crosstalk, and supports 1 Gbps with 100 MHz. CAT 6 supports 250 MHz bandwidth and Gigabit speed. CAT 6a is an STP cable with specialized connectors and supports 10 Gbps and 500 MHz.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We went on to discuss the IEEE 802.3 standard, which specifies a cable identification convention with three primary parts: DTR, signaling mode, and cable identification. 10BaseT represents a 10 Mbps, <strong>baseband</strong> (<strong>Base</strong>), twisted-pair (T) cable. Other standards include 10Base2, 10Base5, 10Base-FL, 100BaseTX, 100BaseT4, 100BaseFX, 1000BaseT, 1000BaseCX, and 10GbE.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Next, we turned to fiber-optic cabling. This has two advantages over copper twisted-pair cables: range and bandwidth. The maximum range on fiber-optic lines is around 20 km, and they generally support bandwidth in the 10 Gbps to 100 Gbps range. Fiber-optic cables have five layers: core, cladding, protective layer (buffer), Kevlar layer, and an outer jacket.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We looked at how fiber-optic cabling operates in two modes: SM and MM. SM has one fiber filament and carries a single transmission. SM has higher bandwidth than MM, and an attenuation point up to 50 times farther. MM transmits several light streams at once.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at fiber-optic cable connectors. FOCIS specifies standards for the plugs and sockets of connectors. LC is smaller than other connectors, but includes a standard ceramic ferrule connector. SC and ST have been the dominant fiber-optic connectors because of their high performance. SFP is a transceiver for connecting FC and GbE to switches and other devices through an LC connector.</p>
<p>Finally, we discussed how each physical cable medium has its own handling and installation guidelines that prevent interference, cable damage, and signal loss due to improper installation. Install cable at a 90-degree angle in accordance with the cable's bend radius specification, which is not less than 1 inch. Follow cable pathways and avoid crossing hallways and large open areas.</p>
<p>You should install cable supports in open areas. Common cable supports include cable ducts, hangers, raceways, sleeves, ties, and trays. Cables should be at least 6 inches from low voltage electrical lines and 12 inches from high-voltage lines and devices. Label all cable runs at each end. Cable installed in HVAC ducts must be plenum-rated.</p>
