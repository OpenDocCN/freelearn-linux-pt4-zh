    a server, it has been well tested in a test environment, run in a simulated production
    environment, and released to the production environment under close monitoring.
    Well, okay. Perhaps not all software goes through such a rigorous test and trial
    process as this, even though they should. Besides errors in logic, programming
    structure, and interfacing, what looks like a software error could be a hardware
    fault reflecting through a piece of software. Or, the software may be incompatible
    with the platform on which it's installed.

    software problems are separated into two groups—hardware-related software problems

    a portion of secondary storage that the operating system treats as an extension
    of main memory. Virtual memory, also known as **swap** file, allows more jobs
    to run on the computer. The operating system moves portions of idle jobs out of
    the main memory into virtual memory to allow an active job to use the now-available
    memory space. The drawback to virtual memory is that most secondary storage devices,

    can temporarily store idle programs and data. When you minimize a window on the

    it out of RAM and into a pagefile, the other jobs competing for RAM are able to
    run a bit faster. So, *what happens if the pagefile becomes corrupted?* The good
    news is that virtual memory is only used when there is not enough RAM to support
    the jobs running on the computer. If you never run out of RAM, the pagefile is
    idle anyway. Otherwise, run the `sfc /scannow` command that we discussed earlier
    to repair the pagefile.

- en: When a very small file is written to a hard disk, it's placed in a small disk
    area called a **sector**, which is typically 512 bytes in length. If a larger
    file, say one that is 1 MB, is written to the hard disk, obviously it won't fit
    into one sector. Therefore, the disk controller will break the file into about
    2,000 pieces and store each into a sector. Not all of the available sectors are
    necessarily contiguous, so the file pieces end up being store all over the medium.
    As other files, large and small, take up sectors throughout the disk and the pieces
    of our first file reduce, enlarge, or disappear, sectors become open and new sectors
    are created. As sectors come and go, the original placement of the file pieces
    becomes more distributed and randomized. This is **fragmentation**.

    file corruption, system hang-ups, and data errors or loss. It can also cause performance
    problems such as slowing I/O operations, lengthening the time for disk scans,
    and increasing the condition of disk thrashing. Defragmentation utilities shuffle
    the file pieces around so that the pieces of a file are as close to being on sequential
    sectors and sequential tracks as logically and physically possible.

- en: Printers of all types have remained an essential part of any network, large

- en: A **print server** is either software or a dedicated device that provides an
    interface between network clients and one or more network printers. It is also
    a **single point of failure** (**SPOF**) in most cases. As with software and hardware,
    there is no one standard protocol used for sending a print job to a print server
    and then on to the printer. Adding a print server to a network can solve a number
    of printing issues, not only for users, but for the administrators as well.

    warnings and errors on Windows can be resolved using compression, the Windows
    Disk Management utility, and unneeded data in temporary or search work files.
