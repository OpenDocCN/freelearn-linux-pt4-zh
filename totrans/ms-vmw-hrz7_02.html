                    <h1 class="header-title">Introducing VDI and VMware Horizon 7</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>n the first chapter of this book, we are going to start by discussing what we mean when we talk about <strong>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure</strong> <span>(</span><strong>VDI</strong><span>)</span> and define exactly what this means. Once we have defined this, we will go on to discuss the specifics of it in the context of the VMware Horizon solution.</p>
<p><span>Throughout this book we have used a number of screenshots to demonstrate installation and configuration of Horizon, using the example lab environment. These screenshots are taken from Horizon 7 version 7.6, however, the latest 7.8 version is exactly the same with the exception of the version number shown on the screenshot, and in some cases the Horizon logo. The process and steps shown remain exactly the same.</span></p>
<p>Horizon provides the foundation to VMware's <strong>End User Computing</strong> (<strong>EUC</strong>) solution for delivering desktops and applications. VMware first entered the VDI market about 16 years ago, when they demonstrated the concept of virtualizing a desktop operating system by using their success in the server virtualization market that is now becoming a more mature and prevalent technology. Taking some of the very same principles that are used in server virtualization, and instead applying them to a desktop operating system, VMware was able to create a centrally-managed, virtualized desktop solution that would lower the overall cost of desktop computing and increase security.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is VDI, and how does it work?</li>
<li>A history of VMware and VDI</li>
<li>VMware Horizon editions and licensing options</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we get into discussing specific product features and functionality, let's define what we mean when we talk about <span>VDI</span>. We'll then take a brief stroll down memory lane and look at where and how it all started for VMware.</p>

<p>When we talk about VDI, we are typically describing a solution whereby a desktop PC's operating system is hosted as a virtual machine that is running on a hypervisor, with the hypervisor hosted on a server that is part of the data center infrastructure, either on-premises or cloud-based.</p>
<p>This VDI model is also sometimes referred to as a <strong>hosted virtual desktop</strong> (<strong>HVD</strong>), given that the virtual desktop is hosted as a virtual machine, with an end user that has access to their own instance of a full desktop. This is not to be confused with server-based computing, which only delivers a desktop session to the end user. We will discuss this in the <em>VDI versus server-based computing (SBC) – what are the differences?</em> section later in this chapter.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">VDI high-level architecture – how does it work?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>How does VDI work? Let's start with the end user and how they access a virtual desktop machine. From their endpoint device (a PC, thin client, or mobile device), the end user launches the client software, which is the Horizon client in the case of VMware, or they simply open a browser. Either way, this connects them to a connection broker using its hostname or URL. The job of the connection broker in the first instance is to authenticate the end user and then to manage the available resources and connect the end user to the appropriate virtual desktop. The desktop that's delivered to them could be based on their physical location or on a departmental basis where there are different desktop configurations depending on the context of that user.</p>
<p>The following diagram describes, at a high level, how VDI works:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ce7bbce9-fdc8-46bb-ad33-50f6cee140e0.png"/></div>
<p>In the first VDI solutions that came to market, there was no concept of a connection broker and instead, an end user would connect directly to a virtual desktop machine on a 1:1 basis. It was like picking up their desktop and moving it to the data center.</p>
<p>Once an end user is connected to a virtual desktop machine, the screenshots, or the display of the virtual desktop machine, are sent over the network to the client software or browser on the endpoint device using an optimized delivery protocol. To enable the end user to interact with the virtual desktop, the mouse movements and keystrokes are then sent back to the virtual desktop machine over the network via the same protocol.</p>
<p>Therefore, VDI desktops are more secure as no data leaves the data center, but instead, just the screenshot updates or pixel changes are sent over the network. As per the previous analogy, it's like picking up your PC and putting it in a data center that's miles away from your home and then having your keyboard, mouse, and screen at home with very long cables back to the data center.</p>
<p>That's VDI from a connectivity perspective, but let's focus on the virtual desktop itself for a moment and look at how the architecture differs from a desktop in the physical world. VDI desktops are typically built on demand, that is, when a user logs in and requests a desktop resource. To help manage costs, you would typically deploy a non-persistent desktop model (as discussed in <a href="5d942e5b-dda5-4e5a-8278-62a64210aeef.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em><span>Understanding Horizon 7 Architecture and Components</span></em>) whereby users don't own their desktop and would have a new desktop built for them each time they log in. Therein lies one of the key differences between virtual and physical desktops.</p>
<p>As we just discussed, a virtual desktop typically gets built on demand, bringing together the different components that make up a full desktop environment. The operating system, user profile, desktop policies, and applications are all treated as separate, individual components, abstracted from the underlying machine, and then delivered back together to create the end user's desktop experience.</p>
<p>This is referred to as the composite desktop model, which is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4fb962d4-7a4e-460d-98b3-31f29f2cc6ee.png"/></div>
<p>The key take away here is that virtual desktop machines need to be treated differently from physical desktops, and to reap all the benefits that virtual desktop machines off<span>er</span><span>, they should be built from the ground up and managed as virtual machines from day one, using some of the components that have been specifically designed for the management of VDI. We will discuss this in the next chapter.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>So, what are the differences between these technologies and VDI, if any at all?</p>
<p>SBC is a technology that has been around for some time. In fact, you could probably trace its roots back as far as the 1950s, to the mainframe technology that was designed to deliver centralized compute power to run a set of applications, with users connecting to the applications using a green-screen terminal, which was pretty much just a screen with a keyboard.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, SBC has not changed that much and still runs applications centrally, albeit today, it runs on servers rather than a mainframe, and end users connect using some form of end point terminal. So, in that case, it's not that different to VDI in that you are connecting remotely to applications that are running on server infrastructure hosted in the data center. Or is it?</p>
<p>Let's look at delivering applications first. The difference between VDI and SBC is that with SBC, the applications are installed and run on the actual servers themselves, using a multi-user version of the application to create individual application sessions for each unique end user. The end user would connect to their own individual, separate, and protected session of that application, instead of connecting to an instance of an operating system containing the applications, as they would with VDI. Since everything is running in the data center, users would connect to the session via a terminal or thin client. In fact, SBC is sometimes referred to as thin-client computing.</p>
<p>The following diagram provides an overview of how applications are delivered using SBC/ <strong>Remote Desktop Services</strong> (<strong>RDS</strong>):</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3d4ed0d9-4fbb-4fac-b72e-1025cc5c7401.png"/></div>
<p>Using the SBC model, you can also deliver hosted desktop sessions in the same way. This time, instead of connecting to a separated, protected individual application session, the user now connects to a separated, protected individual session of the server's operating system. One thing to note here is that the end user is essentially running a server-based operating system session such as Windows Server 2016, rather than a Windows 10 desktop session.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, which technology you choose to deploy comes down to your use case, and which technology makes the most sense from both a feature and cost perspective. You may well end up with a hybrid, with the different methods delivering desktops and applications based on different departments within your organization, all of which have distinct requirements.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The benefits of deploying Horizon</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">By virtualizing your end user desktop estate into a centrally-managed service, you can deliver benefits not only to the IT administrators, but also to the users. Some of these are highlighted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Security and compliance</strong>: No data leaves the data center unless the IT department has specifically configured a policy to allow it. Equally, end users cannot introduce malware or other malicious content. All that gets transmitted to the client devices are the screenshots of the virtual desktop, with keyboard and mouse interactions being sent back to the virtual desktop. It's a bit like having a remote control for your desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Centralized and simplified management</strong>: Centralized desktops means centralized management. With desktops being virtualized and hosted in the data center, it is much easier to perform tasks such as updating and patching an operating system or installing new applications en masse, rather than individually. Virtual desktops are created from a single gold or master image that is maintained and updated centrally. You can simply update the image, recreate the virtual desktops with a few mouse clicks, and hey presto <span>–</span> all of your users will get the new updated version. Troubleshooting the environment and user issues become easier, and all without the need for a desk visit. The worse-case scenario is that you just rebuild a new desktop for the end user from scratch or have them log on to a new one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability, flexibility, and agile working</strong>: Having desktops hosted on a virtual platform allows you to scale up and scale down much more easily, without the need to purchase more physical desktops. Time to deployment is much quicker and costs are reduced. Desktops or even complete environments can be spun up quickly and taken down just as easily to accommodate seasonal workers, contractors working on specific projects, or even to deliver DR and business continuity. Costs can further be reduced with end user devices, and they can now take advantage of thin client devices, or even connect using their own personal devices. As resources are now moved to the data center server infrastructure and accessed remotely, end users have access to their virtual desktops wherever they are and no longer need to be in the office, at a desk, or require a PC to access their corporate desktop and applications. They can continue to be productive, even when experiencing bad weather, bad traffic, or other events that usually prevent them from getting into the office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile and BYOD from anywhere</strong>: Virtual desktop clients enable mobile devices, tablets, and non-corporate-owned devices to connect securely to corporate virtual desktops. Following the flexible working theme, users can now choose a device that suits their needs so that they can access their corporate desktop. Whether it be a tablet, a smartphone, or a non-Windows platform, users can still access their corporate desktop securely from remote locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost savings</strong>: Implementing a virtual desktop environment and adopting operational best practices around image, patch, and profile management with centralized application deployment can result in saving <strong>operational expenditure</strong> (<strong>OPEX</strong>), compared to traditional desktop management. <strong>Capital expenditure</strong> (<strong>CAPEX</strong>) is still required to support the virtual desktop environment and get it up and running. One of the things I hear all the time is that deploying VDI will reduce costs. The point to make here is that yes, it will reduce OPEX, but typically, the CAPEX at the beginning of a VDI project will be higher as you deploy the infrastructure. Having said that, there are cost savings to be made here too, with repurposing endpoints into thin clients, for example. Overall though, these costs will reduce through savings in the ongoing management of the solution, and you will not be caught in the typical three-year desktop-hardware refresh-cycle trap with OS and application updates, which are now deployed centrally to virtual machines.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>The concept of virtualizing Windows desktops has been around since as early as 2002 when VMware customers started virtualizing desktop operating systems and hosting them on servers running the ESXi hypervisor from the data center. At that time, there was no concept of a connection broker, and the phrase VDI was never commonly used. End users simply connected, using the RDP protocol, directly to a dedicated desktop virtual machine running Windows XP. This was the same as how you would manage a server remotely, that is, by making an RDP connection directly to the desktop of the server. From there, the journey began. The following timeline highlights the key milestones of that journey:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2005</strong>: VMware demonstrated the concept of a connection broker.</li>
<li><strong>2006</strong>: <span>VMware launched the VDI alliances program.</span></li>
<li><strong>2007</strong>: A prototype connection broker was introduced to customers, before being released as a product called <strong>Virtual Desktop Manager</strong> <span>(</span><strong>VDM</strong><span>) version</span> <span>1.0</span><span>.</span> <span>VMware acquired Propero for $25 million.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>2008</strong>: VDM 2.0 was released in January 2008.</span> VMware View 3.0 released and <span>Citrix entered the VDI market, releasing XenDesktop 2.0.</span></li>
<li><strong>2009</strong>: VMware View 4.0 released—the first version with PCoIP.</li>
<li><strong>2010</strong>: VMware View 4.5 was released with new features such as local mode (offline desktops), PCoIP enhancements, Windows 7 support, and the ability to tier storage. This was also the year that VMware talked publicly about the biggest VDI reference case to date with Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, who deployed 50,000 virtual desktop machines.</li>
<li><strong>2011</strong>: VMware view 4.6 released with the iPad client, and the PCoIP Secure Gateway function for the View Security Server, which allows users to connect to their virtual desktop without needing a VPN connection. View 5.0 released with the introduction of Persona Management. View 5.0 also introduced 3D graphics support by using the latest vSphere 5.0 platform, as well as some major enhancements to the PCoIP protocol.</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong>: View 5.1 released with View Storage Accelerator, View Composer Array Integration, the ability to scale the hosting infrastructure up to a 32-node cluster when using NFS storage, radius two-factor authentication, improved USB device support, a standalone View Composer, and the ability to support profile migration from XP to Windows 7, as well as from physical desktops to virtual desktops, with Persona Management.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>2013</strong>: View 5.2 released, and to bring it in line with VMware's launch of the new Horizon brand (launched at the same time), it was renamed Horizon View 5.2. This included support for unified comms with Microsoft Lync 2013, hardware-accelerated graphics with <strong>Virtual Shared Graphics Acceleration</strong> <span>(</span><strong>vSGA</strong><span>), Windows 8 support, and a feature pack that allowed a user to access their desktop in an HTML5 browser using the VMware Blast protocol.</span> View 5.3 introduced <strong>Virtual Dedicated Graphics Acceleration</strong> <span>(</span><strong>vDGA</strong><span>), which allowed a virtual desktop to have dedicated access to a GPU that was installed on the host server. Support for Windows Server 2008 R2 was added to the virtual desktop machine to get around the fact there is no</span> <strong>Service Provider License Agreement</strong> <span>(</span><strong>SPLA</strong><span>) for Windows 7.</span></li>
<li><strong>2014</strong>: This was the final 5.x release with Horizon View 5.3.1, which added support for <strong>Virtual SAN</strong> <span>(</span><strong>VSAN</strong><span>).</span> Horizon 6.0 was released, adding View-hosted apps, and was the first time that VMware supported hosted apps and desktops using RDS. View 6.0 also introduced the Cloud Pod Architecture, and the ability to span the View infrastructure across multiple data centers for DR and scalability. Removal of View Local Mode was also included. In the 6.0.1 release, USB 3.0 support was added, as well as extended printing, HTML access for Windows 8.x, and system tray redirection for hosted applications. This was followed by the 6.0.2 release, which included a new feature pack that added new versions of the View Agent, HTML access, MMR redirection, and scanner redirection.</li>
<li><strong>2015</strong>: View 6.1 was released with support for NVIDIA GRID vGPU. It also added support for IPV6, Virtual SAN 6.0, Virtual Volumes, and Windows Server 2012 R2 running as the virtual desktop operating system. 6.1.1 then launched, adding features such as client drive redirection, support for Linux desktops, MMR for RDS desktops, and HTML support for accessing hosted apps. Horizon 6.2 added support for Windows 10 desktops, Access Point integration, AMD vDGA, 4K monitors, and Virtual SAN 6.1, along with several enhancements to the Cloud Pod Architecture, admin console, and Linux desktops. A maintenance release was included 6.2.1 in December 2015, and 6.2.2 in February 2016.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, this timeline is shown pictorially in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/21df7f0b-d6dc-4af3-9487-1562759b3b52.png"/></div>
<p>That brings us right up to date and to the latest version of Horizon, VMware Horizon 7.</p>

<p>VMware Horizon 7 is the next generation of VMware's EUC vision and strategy to deliver the digital workspace. In the previous sections, we discussed some of the differences between VDI and SBC/RDS, and the advantages of the two solutions. However, with Horizon 7, you can deliver VDI desktops, published applications, and session-based desktops, all from a single platform.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>VMware Horizon 7 was released on March 22, 2016, and included some brand new features, as well as some ones. The full release notes can be found at <a href="https://bit.ly/2O3ZYoG">https://bit.ly/2O3ZYoG</a>, with the highlights listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant Clones for faster desktop provisioning</li>
<li>Cloud Pod Architecture for 25 pods, across 5 sites, and up to 50,000 sessions</li>
<li>Smart policies</li>
<li>VMware Blast Extreme protocol with both TCP and UDP transport support</li>
<li>True SSO</li>
<li>Access Point integration</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A tech preview of Windows Server 2016 running as an RDS server for remote desktops and apps</li>
<li>Broader support for Linux operating systems</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial Horizon 7 release was then followed up with three minor update releases; 7.0.1 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2QkCrBA">https://bit.ly/2QkCrBA</a>) added enhancements to Blast and the Linux-based virtual desktop; Horizon 7.0.2 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2NvorGw">https://bit.ly/2NvorGw</a>) added Client Drive Redirection, Horizon PowerCLI, RTAV for session-based desktops and apps, support for Windows 10 Build 1507, 1511, and 1607, plus support for vSphere 6.5; and Horizon 7.0.3 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2QfsTaZ">https://bit.ly/2QfsTaZ</a>) removed the View PowerCLI and replaced it with the Horizon PowerCLI. There were also Horizon Agent updates, particularly for Linux desktops, which added vGPU support, Persona Management support for V6 profiles, and updated Horizon clients.</p>
<p>Next came the VMware Horizon 7.1 release on March 16, 2017 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2Mj462g">https://bit.ly/2Mj462g</a>). The View Connection Server received numerous updates, along with new features for Blast Extreme and published apps and desktops, Instant Clones, and Cloud Pod Architecture. The ADM template files in the Horizon GPO bundle were deprecated and replaced with ADMX template files.</p>
<p>After 7.1 came VMware Horizon 7.2, which was released on Jun 20, 2017 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2QjAVzj">https://bit.ly/2QjAVzj</a>). This version again concentrated on Connection Server updates, including Workspace ONE Access Policies, Instant Clone enhancements, Cloud Pod Architecture, which now supports 120,000 sessions, and the addition of the Horizon Help Desk Tool. Connection Server limits were also increased, now supporting 4,000 clones per vCenter server. Skype support was added to the Horizon Agent, along with an update for the Horizon Client.</p>
<p>The 7.3 release in October 2017 was found to have a few issues and so it was removed from the download page with a jump straight to VMware Horizon 7.3.2, which was released on November 20, 2017 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2QhM8Ax">https://bit.ly/2QhM8Ax</a>). This release included updates for the Horizon Help Desk Tool and Instant Clones, and an increase in regards to the scale of the Cloud Pod Architecture to 140,000 sessions across 7 sites. Again, more features were added to the Horizon Client, particularly the Linux version, along with a new Horizon Client release, version 4.6.</p>
<p>There were similar updates in VMware Horizon 7.4, which was released on Jan 04, 2018 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2BFJE6q">https://bit.ly/2BFJE6q</a>), which also added session collaboration, a host of new ADMX templates, and an update to Horizon Client version 4.7.</p>
<p>Released on May 29, 2018, VMware Horizon 7.5 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2lBvrBU">https://bit.ly/2lBvrBU</a>) concentrated on a number of new features for the connection server, adding the Horizon Console web interface that is now integrated the Horizon Help Desk Tool, and integration of the new workflow features for the just-in-time Management Platform, including the Horizon JMP Server installer. This release also added support for vSphere 6.7, along with the ability to deploy desktop pools that contain full virtual machines on VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>
<p><span>The Cloud Pod Architecture saw another increase in scale, and it now supports 200,000 sessions across 10 sites. Finally, there were several Horizon Agent enhancements and a new Horizon Client release with Horizon Client 4.8.</span></p>
<p>A maintenance release came next with Horizon 7.5.1 on July 19, 2018 (<a href="https://bit.ly/2oVxKS2">https://bit.ly/2oVxKS2</a>). This fixed an issue with the insecure logging of credentials, as described in CVE-2018-6971 (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-6971">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-6971</a>).</p>
<p>That brings us right up to date with the latest release, VMware Horizon 7.6, which was released on Sep 6, 2018. This minor release incorporated updates for the connection server, the Horizon Agent, additional features for the Horizon GPO bundle, and a new Horizon Client, version 4.9.</p>
<p>To summarize, this timeline is shown pictorially in the following diagram:</p>

<p>As the name implies, <strong>Horizon for Linux</strong> allows you to centralize Linux-based virtual desktop machines and deliver them with Horizon View. The big advantage of Linux desktops is that you can move away from other, costlier, operating systems, further reducing the cost of deployment. Horizon for Linux supports several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, RHEL, and CentOS, and it also takes advantage of some of the other features that View has to offer, such as NVIDIA graphics solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Horizon Standard Edition</strong> delivers the core VDI components and features to allow for the delivery of Windows-based virtual desktop machines to end users. Included in this edition is the licensing for the hosting infrastructure, vSphere, and vCenter for desktops. Also included is ThinApp, VMware's application virtualization and packaging solution, which allows you to extract applications from the underlying OS and deliver them back independently.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Horizon Advanced Edition is all about virtual desktop and application delivery and management. Advanced Edition is the first edition that includes application publishing as part of the View solution, allowing an application running on a Microsoft RDSH backend to be published via the View client using the PCoIP protocol, HTML, or VMware Blast Extreme. This feature means that a user can now just have an individual application delivered to their client device, rather than a full-blown desktop.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Also included in the Advanced Edition is a unified workspace solution that delivers a unified workspace, so that users can select applications from a catalog of entitled applications. These applications can be ThinApp packages, SaaS-based applications, XenApp published applications, and anything from Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The Advanced Edition also used to include VMware Mirage, so that you could deliver centralized image management for physical desktops. However, that product is now at its end-of-life, along with Horizon Flex. Although you can no longer purchase these products, VMware are still offering technical support up until <span>June 30, 2020 for those customers who have them deployed.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">Finally, Advanced Edition includes support for Skype, VMware Identity Manager, and VSAN.</p>

<p>Horizon Enterprise Edition builds on the previous versions and adds features to deliver operations management by using vRealize Operations for Horizon. This, coupled with the Horizon Help Desk Tool, gives IT admins the ability to monitor the health and performance of the environment, as well as capacity-planning capabilities for ensuring the most optimal configuration as you scale.</p>
<p>Also included in the Enterprise Edition is VMware App Volumes, which allows you to deliver just-in-time applications to a virtual desktop. This works alongside the just-in-time delivery with Instant Clone Technology to build and deliver desktops and apps on demand. These are then configured for end users using the VMware User Environment Management solution. For a detailed overview of VMware App Volumes, you can read <em>Learning VMware App Volumes</em>, by Peter von Oven and published by Packt.</p>
<p>Enterprise Edition also added support for delivering Linux-based desktops and session collaboration, which allows users to easily work together.</p>

<p>Horizon is available in two different licensing models, which are also based on the edition you deploy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concurrent user</strong>: Available for all Horizon editions where the license is based on the number of simultaneous users accessing apps and desktops.</li>
<li><strong>Named user</strong>: Available for all Horizon editions, with the exception of Horizon for Linux and Horizon Standard Edition. With a named user, the license is assigned to specific users.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this chapter, we looked at what VDI is, described how it works, and how it compares to other, similar technologies. Next, we covered the history of where it all began for VMware, demonstrating that VMware was—and still is—at the forefront of virtual desktop and application delivery, which today is more commonly referred to as the digital workspace.</p>
<p>We then went on to discuss the latest release, VMware Horizon 7, and the different editions that are available, with an overview of each edition and its core set of features.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will take a deep dive into the technology of Horizon View and start looking at the architecture and the different components that make up the solution.</p>
