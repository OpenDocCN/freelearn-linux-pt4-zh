    corruption and accidental or malicious erasure, doesn't exist—not yet, anyway.
    In the meantime, disk, tape, and optical storage devices continue to have their

    and their respective causes that you should expect to encounter in the Server+

    defined and steadfastly followed data backup policy and procedure. A full system
    backup and incremental or differential backups are our insurance policy for any
    data storage device's failure. *Why do we need an insurance policy?* Well, we
    store one of our organization's most valuable assets (data) on what we believe
    is a reliable device. We then power it with one of the most unreliable and frequently
    failing devices in a PC—the power supply. If it avoids power issues, it's subject
    to viruses, physical damage, bad application software, and erroneous device drivers.
    On top of all that, there's the human. It's no wonder that data storage devices
    can develop problems.

    it''s relatively easy to damage it. Most data storage device problems occur during
    system startup. These problems are generally in the hard disk controller, but
    may also be in HDDs, as well. However, other forms of data storage devices can

    HDD problems and their effect on stored data. The following are issues you may

    be in the disk housing or on the motherboard as a function of the chipset, could
    fail, which eliminates the capability of the OS to read and write from the disk
    medium. The HDD controller provides a go-between service for the OS and the HDD
    device. Commonly, although the message that''s displayed indicates that the controller
    failed, it could very well be the HDD device itself.'
