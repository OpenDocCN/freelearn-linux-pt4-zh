    such as computers supporting one or more servers. What differentiates ECC memory
    from non-ECC memory is that ECC memory modules include a dedicated memory unit
    that provides parity and error-correction to the other memory units of the module.
    ECC memory provides assurance of data integrity. Before ECC technology, the method
    used for error-correction was parity, either even or odd. Non-ECC memory has no
    error-correcting capability and acts only to fulfill requests from the processor.
