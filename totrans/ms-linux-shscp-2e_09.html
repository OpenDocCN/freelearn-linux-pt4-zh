<p>Now that we have seen a little of the <strong>stream editor</strong> (<strong>sed</strong>), we can put this knowledge into practice. In <a href="9d994c56-8311-4871-af5a-1e7c9b2449d5.xhtml" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 8</span></a>, <em>Introducing the Stream Editor</em>, we familiarized ourselves with some of the capabilities of <kbd>sed</kbd>; however, this represented just a small amount of the power enclosed in the editor. In this chapter, we are going to exercise <kbd>sed</kbd> a little more and expose ourselves to some practical uses of the tool, especially when using our bash scripts.</p>
<p>In this journey, we will use <kbd>sed</kbd> to help us automate the creation of Apache name-based Virtual Hosts. The Apache hosts are practical users of the <kbd>sed</kbd> that we demonstrated but, more importantly, we will use <kbd>sed</kbd> to search for selected lines in the main configuration. We will then uncomment those lines and save them as a template. Having created the template, we will create new configurations from it. The concept that we demonstrate with Apache can be applied in many different situations.</p>
<p>We will find that using <kbd>sed</kbd> in our shell scripts will allow us to easily extract template data from the main configuration and adjust to the needs of the virtual host. In this way, we will be able to extend the knowledge of both <kbd>sed</kbd> and shell scripting. In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache name-based Virtual Hosts</li>
<li>Automating virtual host creation</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CentOS 7.x machine</li>
<li>Apache 2.4.x web server installed</li>
</ul>
<p>You can install Apache as follows:</p>
<pre>    <strong>$ sudo yum install httpd</strong></pre>
<p>Then you can start the web server:</p>
<pre>    <strong>$ systemctl start httpd</strong> </pre>
<p>You can ensure that the service is already running by checking the status as follows:</p>
<pre>    <strong>$ systemctl status httpd </strong>  </pre>

<p>For this demonstration, we will be working with the <kbd>httpd.conf</kbd> file from an Apache 2.4 HTTPD server taken from a CentOS 7.x host. To be perfectly honest, we are far more interested in the configuration file, as Red Hat or CentOS supply it, than the actual configuration changes that we will make. The file will be available for download from the code bundle of the chapter. Our purpose is to learn how we can extract data from the system-supplied file and create a template from it. We can apply this to Apache configuration files or any other text data file. It is the methodology we are looking at, not the actual result.</p>
<p>To have some understanding of what we are trying to do, we must first look at the <kbd>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</kbd> file, that is, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Scientific Linux. The following screenshot shows the virtual host section of the file that we are interested in:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f9a17c54-dd2e-4899-8560-4800a72360e6.png" style="width:32.67em;height:7.92em;"/></div>
<p>Looking at these lines, we can see that they are commented and this is all a part of a monolithic <kbd>httpd.conf</kbd>. While creating virtual hosts, we normally prefer separate configurations for each of our potential virtual hosts. We need to be able to extract this data from the main file and at the same time uncomment it. We can then save this uncommented data as a template.</p>
<p>Using this template, we will create new configuration files that represent different named <kbd>hosts</kbd> that we need to have running on one instance of Apache. This enables us to host <kbd>sales.example.com</kbd> and <kbd>marketing.example.com</kbd> on a single server. Both sales and marketing will have their own configuration and websites, independent from each other. Additionally, it will also be very easy to add additional sites that we need with the template we create. It becomes the task of the main web server to read the incoming HTTP header requests to the server and direct them to the correct site based on the domain name used.</p>
<p>Our first task then will be to extract the data present between the opening and closing <kbd>VirtualHost</kbd> tags, uncomment it, and save it to a template. This will only need to be done once and will not be a part of our main script to create the virtual hosts.</p>

<p>As we are not going to test the virtual hosts we create, we will make a copy of the <kbd>httpd.conf</kbd> file and work with that locally in our <kbd>home</kbd> directory. This is good practice while developing the scripts so as not to impact the working configuration. The <kbd>httpd.conf</kbd> file that I am working with should be able to be downloaded with other script resources referred to in the script from the publisher. Alternatively, you can copy it from your CentOS host with Apache installed. Make sure that the <kbd>httpd.conf</kbd> file is copied to your <kbd>home</kbd> directory and that you are working in your <kbd>home</kbd> directory.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The very first step in creating the template is to isolate the lines that we need. In our case, this will be the lines included in the sample virtual host definition that we saw in the earlier screenshot. This includes the opening and closing tag for the <kbd>VirtualHost</kbd> and everything in between. We can use line numbers for this; however, this <span>will</span><span> </span><span>probably not be reliable, as we will need to assume that nothing has changed in the file for the line numbers to be consistent. For completeness, we will show this before moving onto a more reliable mechanism.</span></p>
<p>First, we will remind ourselves of how we can print the whole file with <kbd>sed</kbd>. This is important, as in the next step we will filter the display and show only the lines that we want:</p>
<pre><strong>$ sed -n ' p ' httpd.conf</strong></pre>
<p>The <kbd>-n</kbd> option is used to suppress the standard output and the <kbd>sed</kbd> command within the quotes is <kbd>p</kbd>; it is used to display the pattern match. As we have not filtered anything here, the matched pattern is the complete file. If we were to use line numbers to filter, we could add line numbers easily with <kbd>sed</kbd>, as shown in the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ sed = httpd.conf</strong> </pre>
<p>From the following screenshot, we can see that, in this system, we need to work with just lines <kbd>355</kbd> to <kbd>361</kbd>; however, I do stress again that these numbers may vary from file to file:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f785771f-f921-41b5-9f00-db71ec14fc7e.png" style="width:38.00em;height:9.50em;"/></div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Isolating lines</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To display these lines encased with the tags, we can add a number range to <kbd>sed</kbd>. This is easily achieved by adding those numbers to <kbd>sed</kbd>, as shown in the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ sed -n '355,361 p ' httpd.conf</strong> </pre>
<p>With the range of lines specified, we have been able to <span>easily</span><span> isolate the lines that we required, and the only lines that are now displayed are those of the virtual host definition. We can see this in the following screenshot, which displays both the command and the output:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bbce939a-ad7b-4f6c-9054-1d41b9bf7d01.png" style="width:32.83em;height:13.33em;"/></div>
<p>The issue that we face while hardcoding in the line numbers is that we lose flexibility. These line numbers relate to this file and maybe only this file. We will always need to check the correct line numbers in the file that relate to the file we are working with. This could be an issue if the lines are not conveniently at the end of the file and we have to scroll back to try and locate the correct line numbers. To overcome these issues, instead of using line numbers, we can implement a search for the opening and closing tags directly:</p>
<pre><strong>$ sed -n '/^#&lt;VirtualHost/,/^#&lt;\/VirtualHost/p' httpd.conf</strong></pre>
<p>We are no longer using the starting number and ending number but the more reliable starting regular expression and closing regular expression. The opening regular expression looks for the line that begins with <kbd>#&lt;VirtualHost</kbd>. The ending regular expression is searching for the closing tag. However, we need to protect the <kbd>/VirtualHost</kbd> with an escape character. By looking at the end of the regular expression, we see that it translates to lines that begin with <kbd>#\/VirtualHost</kbd>, with the escaped forward slash.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>If you recall from </span><a href="9d994c56-8311-4871-af5a-1e7c9b2449d5.xhtml" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 8</span></a><span>, </span><em>Introducing the Stream Editor</em><span>, we specify the lines that begin with a specified character by using the carat (</span><kbd>^</kbd><span>).</span></div>
<p>By looking at the following screenshot, we can now isolate the required lines more reliably and without knowing the line numbers. This is more desirable across edited files, which will differ in their line numbering:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/05b1cee3-913c-49fe-b421-b118d3f1c8a4.png" style="width:41.50em;height:12.92em;"/></div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">sed script files</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Isolating the lines was only the first step! We still have to uncomment the lines and then save the result as a template. Although we can write this as one single <kbd>sed</kbd> command string, we can already see that it will be awkwardly long and difficult to read and edit. Thankfully, the <kbd>sed</kbd> command does have the option to read its commands from an input file, often known as a script. We use the <kbd>-f</kbd> option with <kbd>sed</kbd> to specify the file we want to read as our control.</p>
<p>We have already seen that we can isolate the correct lines from the file. So, the first line of the script configures the lines that we will work with. We implement the brace brackets <kbd>{}</kbd> to define a code block immediately after the selected lines.<br/>
A code block is one or more commands that we want to run on a given selection.</p>
<p>In our case, the first command will be to remove the comment and the second command will be to write the pattern space to a new file. The <kbd>sed</kbd> script should look like the following example:</p>
<pre>/^#&lt;VirtualHost/,/^#&lt;\/VirtualHost/ { 
s/^#// 
w template.txt 
} </pre>
<p>We can save this file as <kbd>$HOME/vh.sed</kbd>.</p>
<p>In the first line, we select the lines to work with, as we have previously seen, and then open the code block with the left brace. In line 2, we use the <kbd>substitute</kbd> command, <kbd>s</kbd>. This looks for lines that start with a comment or <kbd>#</kbd>. We replace the comment with an empty string. There are no characters or spaces between the middle and end forward slash. In English, we are uncommenting the line but, to the code, this is replacing the <kbd>#</kbd> with an empty string. The final line of code uses the write command, <kbd>w</kbd>, to save this to <kbd>template.txt</kbd>. To help you see this, we have included the following screenshot of the <kbd>vh.sed</kbd> file:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/031db5bb-0f0c-4dd9-b5a7-af6db24f876c.png" style="width:24.58em;height:6.33em;"/></div>
<p>We can see all of our efforts come to fruition now by ensuring that we are in the same directory as the <kbd>httpd.conf</kbd> and <kbd>vh.sed</kbd> files that are executing the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ sed -nf vh.sed httpd.conf</strong>  </pre>
<p>We have now created the <kbd>template.txt</kbd> file within our working directory. This is the isolated uncommented text from the <kbd>httpd.conf</kbd> file. In simple terms, we have extracted the seven correct lines from over 350 lines of text in milliseconds, removed the comment, and saved the result as a new file. The <kbd>template.txt</kbd> file is displayed in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/811b11f3-8a1a-4c29-a560-9ff3cde9a039.png" style="width:33.67em;height:14.08em;"/></div>
<p>Now we have a template file that we can begin to work with to create virtual host definitions. Even though it's Apache that we have been looking at, the same idea of uncommenting the text or removing the first character of selected lines can apply to many situations, so take this as an idea of what <kbd>sed</kbd> can do.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>After having created the template, we can now use this to create virtual host configurations. In the simplest terms, we need to replace the <kbd>dummy-host.example.com</kbd> URL with the <kbd>sales.example.com</kbd> or <kbd>marketing.example.com</kbd> URL. Of course, we have to also create the <kbd>DocumentRoot</kbd> directory, the directory where the web pages will be, and also add some basic content. When we use a script to run through the process, nothing will be forgotten and the edits will be accurate every time. The basics of the script will be as follows:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash 
WEBDIR=/www/docs 
CONFDIR=/etc/httpd/conf.d 
TEMPLATE=$HOME/template.txt 
[ -d $CONFDIR ] || mkdir -p $CONFDIR 
sed s/dummy-host.example.com/$1/ $TEMPLATE &gt; $CONFDIR/$1.conf 
mkdir -p $WEBDIR/$1 
echo "New site for $1" &gt; $WEBDIR/$1/index.html </pre>
<p>We can ignore the shebang in the first line; we should know this by now. We can start our explanation on line 2 of the script:</p>
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Line</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>WEBDIR=/www/docs/</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We initialize the <kbd>WEDIR</kbd> variable that we store in the path to the directory that will hold the different websites.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>CONFDIR=/etc/httpd/conf.d</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We initialize the <kbd>CONFDIR</kbd> variable that we will use to store the newly created virtual host configuration file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>TEMPLATE=$HOME/template.txt</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We initialize the variable that we will use for the template. This should point to the path of our template.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>[ -d $CONFDIR ] || mkdir -p "$CONFDIR"</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>On a working <kbd>EL6</kbd> host, this directory will exist and is included in the main configuration. If we are running this as a pure test, then we can create a directory to prove that we can create the correct configuration within the target directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>sed s/dummy-host.example.com/$1/ $TEMPLATE &gt;$CONFDIR/$1.conf</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The <kbd>sed</kbd> command works as an engine in the script, running the search and replace operations. Using the substitute command in <kbd>sed</kbd>, we search for the dummy text and replace it with the argument passed to the script.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>mkdir -p $WEBDIR/$1</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Here, we create the correct subdirectory to house the websites for the new virtual host.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>echo "New site for $1" &gt; $WEBDIR/$1/index.html</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>In this final step, we create a basic holding page for the website.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>We can create this script as <kbd>$HOME/bin/vhost.sh</kbd>. <span>Don't forget to add the execute permission. </span>This is illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4cd77cda-d45d-4a9b-8cf4-6ead4cf50293.png" style="width:34.75em;height:15.17em;"/></div>
<p>To create the sales virtual host and web page, we can run the script as shown in the following example. We will be running the script directly as the root user. Alternatively, you may choose to make use of the <kbd>sudo</kbd> command within the script:</p>
<pre><strong># vhost.sh sales.example.com</strong>  </pre>
<p>We can now see how easily we can create virtual hosts using a well-crafted script. The configuration file for the virtual host will be created in the <kbd>/etc/httpd/conf.d/</kbd> directory and will be named <kbd>sales.example.com.conf</kbd>. The file will look similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7b748709-5d4d-49e9-aef9-bf0a8e98ef37.png" style="width:33.25em;height:12.42em;"/></div>
<p>The website content must have been created in the <kbd>/www/docs/sales.example.com</kbd> directory. This will be a simple holding page that proves the point that we can do this from the script. Using the following command, we can list the content or the base directory that we use to house each site:</p>
<pre><strong>$ ls -R /www/docs</strong>  </pre>
<p>The <kbd>-R</kbd> option allows for the recursive listing. We have used the <kbd>/www/docs</kbd> directory purely as this is set in the original virtual host definition that we extracted. You may prefer to use <kbd>/var/www</kbd> or something similar if working in a live environment rather than creating the new directory at the root of your filesystem. It would be a simple matter of editing the template that we created and that too could be done with <kbd>sed</kbd> at the time of template creation.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We can now use the script to create the virtual hosts and the content but we have not allowed for any customization other than the virtual hostname. Of course, this is important. After all, it is this virtual hostname that is used in the configuration itself as well as in setting the website directory and the configuration file name.</p>
<p>It is possible that we could allow additional options to be specified during the virtual host creation. We will use <kbd>sed</kbd> to insert the data as required. The <kbd>sed</kbd> command <kbd>i</kbd> is used to insert data before the selection and <kbd>a</kbd> to append after the selection.</p>
<p>For our example, we will add a host restriction to allow only the local network access to the website. We are more interested in inserting data into the file rather than what we are doing with the specific HTTP configuration file. Within the script, we will be adding <kbd>read</kbd> prompts and inserting a <kbd>Directory</kbd> block into the configuration.</p>
<p>To try and explain what we are trying to do, we should see something similar to the following when executing the script. You can see from the text that we are creating this for the marketing site and adding in restrictions as to who can access the site:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9f7eb3a4-1c5c-42b3-af9b-2428ce966267.png" style="width:34.17em;height:5.50em;"/></div>
<p>As you can see, we can ask two questions but, if needed, more of them can be added to support customization, the idea being that the additional customization should be accurate and reliable in the same way as the script creation was. You may also choose to elaborate the questions with sample answers, so that the user knows how the network address should be formatted.</p>
<p>To aide script creation, we will copy the original <kbd>vhost.sh</kbd> to <kbd>vhost2.sh</kbd>. We can tidy up a few items in the script to allow for easier expansion and then add in the additional prompts. The new script will look similar to the following code:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash 
WEBDIR=/www/docs/$1 
CONFDIR=/etc/httpd/conf.d 
CONFFILE=$CONFDIR/$1.conf 
TEMPLATE=$HOME/template.txt 
[ -d $CONFDIR ] || mkdir -p $CONFDIR  
sed s/dummy-host.example.com/$1/ $TEMPLATE &gt; $CONFFILE 
mkdir -p $WEBDIR 
echo "New site for $1" &gt; $WEBDIR/index.html 
read -p "Do you want to restrict access to this site? y/n " 
[ ${REPLY^^} = 'n' ] &amp;&amp; exit 0 
read -p "Which network should we restrict access to: " NETWORK 
sed -i "/&lt;\/VirtualHost&gt;/i &lt;Directory $WEBDIR &gt;\ 
  \n  Order allow,deny\ 
  \n  Allow from 127.0.0.1\ 
  \n  Allow from $NETWORK\ 
\n&lt;/Directory&gt;" $CONFFILE </pre>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>Please note that we are not running too many checks in the script. This is to keep our focus on the elements that we are adding rather than a robust script. In your own environment, once you have the script working the way you want, you may need to implement more checks to ensure script reliability.</span></div>
<p>As you can see, we have a few more lines. The <kbd>WEBDIR</kbd> variable has been adjusted to contain the full path to the directory and, in a similar way, we have added a new variable <kbd>CONFFILE</kbd>, so that we can make a reference to the file directly. If the answer to the first prompt is <kbd>n</kbd> and the user wants no additional customization, the script will exit. If they answer anything other than <kbd>n</kbd> for no, the script will continue and prompt the network to grant access. We can then use <kbd>sed</kbd> to edit the existing configuration and insert the new <kbd>directory</kbd> block. This will default to deny access but allow access from the <kbd>localhost</kbd> and <kbd>NETWORK</kbd> variables. We refer to the <kbd>localhost</kbd> as <kbd>127.0.0.1</kbd> in the code.</p>
<p>To simplify the code for better understanding, the pseudo-code will look like the following example:</p>
<pre><strong>$ sed -i "/SearchText/i NewText &lt;filename&gt;</strong>  </pre>
<p>Here <kbd>SearchText</kbd> represents the line in the file before which we want to insert our text. Also, <kbd>NewText</kbd> represents the new line or lines that will be added before the <kbd>SearchText</kbd>. The <kbd>i</kbd> command directly following the <kbd>SearchText</kbd> dictates that we are inserting text. Using the <kbd>a</kbd> command to append will mean that the text we add will be added after the <kbd>SearchText</kbd>.</p>
<p>We can see the resulting configuration file for <kbd>marketing.example.com</kbd>, as we have created it with the additional <kbd>Directory</kbd> block added in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/013fc804-cb48-41b4-b94f-853ac6c70234.png" style="width:35.67em;height:14.00em;"/></div>
<p>We can see that we have added the new block above the closing <kbd>VirtualHost</kbd> tag. In the script, this is the <kbd>SearchText</kbd> that we use. The <kbd>Directory</kbd> block we add replaces the <kbd>NewText</kbd> in the pseudo-code. When we look at it, it appears more complex as we have embedded the new lines with <kbd>\n</kbd> and formatted the file for easier reading with the line continuation character <kbd>\</kbd>. Again, we have to emphasize that this edit is easy and accurate once the script is created.</p>
<p>For completeness, we include the following screenshot of the script <kbd>vhost2.sh</kbd>:</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have seen how we can extend <kbd>sed</kbd> into some very cool scripts that have allowed us to extract data from files, uncomment selected lines, and write new configurations. Not stopping at that, we also saw how we could use <kbd>sed</kbd> with script that inserts new lines into existing files. I think that <kbd>sed</kbd> will very quickly become your friend and we have created some powerful scripts to support the learning experience.</p>
<p>You may already know this but <kbd>sed</kbd> has a big brother, <kbd>awk</kbd>. In the next chapter, we are going to see how we can use <kbd>awk</kbd> to extract data from files.</p>
