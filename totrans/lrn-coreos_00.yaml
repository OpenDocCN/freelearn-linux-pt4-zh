- en: As more and more applications are moving towards the cloud with server virtualization,
    there is a clear necessity to deploy the user applications and services very fast
    and make them reliable with assured SLA by deploying the services in a right set
    of servers. This becomes more complex when these services are dynamic in nature,
    which results in making these services autoprovisioned and autoscaled over a set
    of nodes. The orchestration of the user application is not limited to deploy the
    services in the right set of server or virtual machines rather to be extended
    to provide network connectivity across these services to provide **Infrastructure
    as a Service** (**IaaS**). Compute, network, and storage are the three main resources
    to be managed by the cloud provider in order to provide (IaaS). Currently, there
    are various mechanisms to handle these requirements in more abstract fashion.
    There are multiple cloud orchestration frameworks, which can manage the compute,
    storage, and networking resources. OpenStack, Cloud Stack, and VMware vSphere
    are some of the cloud platforms that orchestrate these resource pools and provide
    IaaS.

- en: The server virtualization provided by a Virtual Machine (VM) has its own overhead
    of running a separate instance of the operating system on every virtual machine.
    This brings down the number of VM instances that can be run on the server, which
    heavily impacts the operational expense. As Linux namespace, containers technologies,
    such as docker and rkt, are gaining its popularity; one more level of server virtualization
    can be introduced by deploying the application services inside a container rather
    than VM However, there is a necessity of an orchestration and clustering framework
    for the containers or dockers for deploying the services in the cluster, the discovery
    of the service and service parameters, providing network across these containers
    or dockers, and so on. CoreOS is developed for this purpose.

    on Google Chrome. CoreOS is developed primarily for orchestrating applications/services
    over a cluster of nodes. CoreOS extends the existing services provided by Linux
    to work for a distributed cluster and not limited to a single node.
