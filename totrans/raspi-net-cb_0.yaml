- en: A Raspberry Pi 2, with its 900MHz quad-core processor, has more processing power
    than a network server from the late-1990s. Created as an educational tool to inspire
    the next generation of programmers, the Raspberry Pi is also an excellent network
    server. It can be used to share files, host websites, create Internet access points,
    and analyze network traffic. Multiple Raspberry Pis can be clustered to create
    a single, highly available, and fault-tolerant super computer. This book shows
    you how.

- en: The Raspberry Pi Foundation recognized that *computers had become so expensive
    and arcane that programming experimentation on them had to be forbidden by parents*.
    The parental restrictions on using computers had created a *year-on-year decline
    in the numbers and skills levels of the A Level students applying to read Computer
    Science*. So, the Foundation set out to create a computer that was "affordable,
    and powerful enough to provide excellent multimedia, a feature we felt would make
    the board desirable to kids who wouldn't initially be interested in a purely programming-oriented
    device".

    was not limited to educators and school children. Hobbyists were also excited
    to use the inexpensive Linux-based computer in their projects. In February 2015,
    the quad-core Raspberry Pi 2 was released with significantly more power and memory
    than the original, which was more than enough memory and power for many typical
    server applications.

    Pi, including recipes to set up file servers and web servers, create secure wireless
    access points, and analyze network traffic. There is even a recipe to create a
    highly available fault-tolerant supercomputer.
