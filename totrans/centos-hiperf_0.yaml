- en: CentOS is the enterprise level Linux OS, which is 100% binary compatible with
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It acts as a free alternative to RedHat's commercial
    Linux offering, with only a change in the branding. A high performance cluster
    consists of a group of computers that work together as one set parallel, hence
    minimizing or eliminating the downtime of critical services and enhancing the
    performance of the application.

- en: This book is directed toward two groups of system administrators—those who want
    a detailed, step-by-step guide to setting up a high-performance and high-availability
    CentOS 7 cluster and those who are looking for a reference book to help them learn
    the necessary skills to ensure that their systems and the corresponding resources,
    and services are being utilized at their best capacity. No previous knowledge
    of performance tuning is needed to start reading this book, but the reader is
    expected to have at least some degree of familiarity with any spin-off of the
    Fedora family of Linux distributions, preferably CentOS.
