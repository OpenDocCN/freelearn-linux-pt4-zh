<p>Not all network and server security devices and methods installed on, attached to, or integrate with computer hardware and software. The first line of defense for any server-based system, data center, or facility is its physical security. Physical security is all about keeping the computing assets safe, functioning, secure, and away from all intruders. Although we'll treat it as a separate topic, the environmental systems and controls for the physical environment should be a part of an organization's security policies.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll look at the physical security and environmental controls that protect computing systems. The topic areas covered are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-factor authentication</strong> (<strong>MFA</strong>)</li>
<li>General physical security concepts</li>
<li>Environmental controls</li>
<li>Physical safety issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the years in which users could access computers, systems, and networks, user authentication systems evolved from nearly nothing to combining multiple identity factors. This started with requiring user identity codes, then a secret password entered with the username, and now combining two or more identity factors. All of these levels had one primary purpose—to verify the identity of a user seeking access, as certainly as possible.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Perhaps the first password, at least the first one written about, was the voice command used by Ali Baba to access a treasure—<em>open sesame</em>. At one time, a user account or identity code served the purpose of identifying who was accessing a system, which was typically a mainframe or a minicomputer. Eventually, because of sharing among co-workers and their simplistic content, these codes ceased to provide any level of secure access control. User account codes, also known as usernames, commonly consisted of only a first initial and a last name of each user with access to the system, such as <kbd>rprice</kbd>. This a standard practice that's still in use today. Usernames haven't really changed much over their 50-year history, nor has the security they provide, which is essentially none.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You must remember that the primary data storage media for early application systems was primarily removable media, such as hard disk platters, spindle packs, magnetic tape, and floppy disks. Physical security that blocked access to the physical media was a large part of access control.</div>
<p>As application systems grew in sophistication, data storage was on attached or internal disk storage devices. This meant that security had to become an absolute necessity. Maintaining data integrity and security required stronger authentication methods. Adding a <em>secret</em> password to the login process helped to verify that a user requesting access to a system was in fact who he or she purported themselves to be. The underlying assumption was that if the user knew the password, then the user was who the username identified.</p>
<p>The use of a username is merely one step (the identification step) in an authentication process. Pairing a password with the username creates a data bundle that serves as a <strong>single-factor authentication</strong> (<strong>SFA</strong>) value. If the password entered is the value paired with the username in the system's security files, the system grants access to the user.</p>
<p>Eventually, the use of the combined username and password no longer provided the access control and security it once did. Password crackers, social engineering, malware, and other shady means were able to obtain user passwords that lead to accessing the user's personal data. This is where MFA came in.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Authentication factors</h1>
                </header>

<p>MFA combines two or more identification factors to authenticate a user (supplicant) attempting to log on to a system or network. The MFA process involves the combination of two or more factors that uniquely identify the supplicant. So far, MFA can process, in various combinations, five general categories of authentication factors, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Something you know</strong>: This category includes data, phrases, numbers, or any combination thereof that you've memorized and are able to recall when needed. This could be a password, a PIN code, the answer to a question, how many dogs George Washington owned (50), and so on. Usernames and email addresses, although they're something you know, are identifying codes, which is what we're trying to authenticate.</li>
<li><strong>Something you have</strong>: The factors in this category are physical items that contain information that assures that the holder/user of the item is, in fact, who they claim to be. This could be a small plastic token, such as an RSA SecurID, or a number generated from a bank's app on your mobile phone, a <strong>Personal Identity Verification</strong> (<strong>PIV</strong>) smart card or employee badge, or perhaps an RFID proximity card.</li>
<li><strong>Something you are</strong>: Many people confuse this category with the something you have or are categories, but essentially this category is biometrics. Biometrics uses parts of your body to uniquely identify you. Your body features, which can include fingerprints, handprints, retina and iris scans, voice prints, and facial scans, establish a pattern in binary coding, compared to when you attempt to log in.</li>
<li><strong>Somewhere you are</strong>: This type of authentication most commonly uses IP addresses to identify the location or source of a user request. A geolocation service verifies that the location from where a request originates is consistent with the location predefined for the user making the request.</li>
<li><strong>Something you do</strong>: This category incorporates touchpad and touchscreen movements (gestures), something such as a secret hand sign. Windows 8 introduced a feature called <strong>Picture Password</strong> that allowed users to record gestures for use in authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using only one factor, such as just a password, is SFA. Using just two factors is <strong>Two-Factor Authentication</strong> (<strong>2FA</strong>). As you've probably figured out by now, more than two factors in an authentication is MFA. The one thing you should know regarding authentication factors is that the more you use, the safer your data will be.</p>

<p>The physical security of any organization must define the events, causes, actors, prevention, recovery, mitigation, and other relevant procedures regarding the security, safety, and operations of achieving an organization's mission.</p>
<p>A physical security program for any IT organization is based on the overall organization's security policies and plans. The IT security policy must recognize the need and purpose of physical security for the computing assets and functions. The policy that defines the IT physical security program should include the following objectives, and most likely others, depending on the nature of the organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical safeguards that are in place, such as fire safety, intrusion prevention, business continuity, and disaster recovery</li>
<li>The sources and types of threats to the organization</li>
<li>The components of physical security monitoring systems</li>
<li>The impact and recovery from utility service interruptions (electricity, natural gas, water, and so on)</li>
<li>The countermeasures defined or inplace in the event of unauthorized entry, vandalism, or the theft of computing resources</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical security plan typically has two areas of focus—<strong>deterrence</strong> and <strong>detection</strong>. Deterrence procedures, methods, and equipment serve to discourage or prevent threats becoming security events. Detection, of course, involves the equipment, procedures, and methods used to discover events that threaten or defeat the physical security measures.</p>

<p>Threats to the physical security of any organization fall into four general categories—<strong>environmental</strong>, <strong>man-made</strong>, <strong>site-specific</strong>, and <strong>technical</strong>. The following sections give some examples of the threats in each of these categories.</p>

<p>Environmental threats are weather, natural disaster, catastrophic event, and other events from the natural world. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dust</strong>:<strong> </strong>Airborne dust can contribute to electrical problems in a computer, not to mention clogging up the airflow and cooling of the motherboard and CPU.</li>
<li><strong>Earthquake</strong>: The damage threat of an earthquake is usually structural, but with that may come electrical, plumbing, and certainly ventilation issues.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme weather</strong>: This threat could include all sorts of catastrophic weather events, including high winds, heavy rain, tornadoes, hurricanes/typhoons, ice, snow, hail, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Fire/explosion</strong>: In addition to the damage a fire could do to computing equipment, damage could also come from the chemicals in the retardants, suppressors, and extinguishers, not to mention water.</li>
<li><strong>Flood</strong>: Floods are usually a result caused by other weather events, such as extreme weather, earthquakes, or your neighborhood volcano erupting.</li>
<li><strong>Lightning</strong>: Electrical storms are a real and serious threat. A direct lightning strike to the building housing a data center could send an extreme electric spike through even protected equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Pests</strong>: Unfortunately, a mouse chewing through a communication cable or a power cable can introduce hard-to-detect issues for a server and its nodes.</li>

<p>As its name implies, these physical security threats are either a result of omission, negligence, or ignorance, or they come from the evil minds of evil-doers. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accidents</strong>: Accidents may not be totally preventable, but there are measures that can help to minimize their occurrences: safety tread on laminated floor surfaces, proper spacing between equipment and cabinets, safety awareness training for all staff, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Malware</strong>: Computer viruses, trojan horses, rootkits, bots, and other malicious software are a serious threat to any networked device, but especially to network servers.</li>
<li><strong>Theft</strong>: This isn't just the realm of external agents who gain entry to a secured site. Employees, vendors, contractors, and guests, among others, are responsible for a fair amount of equipment, document, and resource theft.</li>
<li><strong>Unauthorized access</strong>: Hackers gaining access to programming, data, and other resources are a threat that the security policies and programs must address. However, no less a threat is unauthorized physical access, which means that an intruder has physically gained entry and access to equipment, data archives, documents and forms, and other computing assets.</li>
<li><strong>Vandalism</strong>: Although typically thought of as defacement or damage to exterior surfaces, vandalism can also be window and fence breakage and damage, fire, and random destruction of equipment and buildings.</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The scope of this group of physical security threats is usually a single site, building, or vicinity. For the most part, they involve purchased or contracted systems or services. Some examples are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication system failure</strong>: Because communication services provide for a variety of communication technologies, which, in turn, can defeat or remove the performance and reliability of voice, data transfer, and feedback systems.</li>
<li><strong>Computing equipment failure</strong>: Obviously, one of the primary risk factors on any network is device and component failures. Physical security policies should address any possible vulnerabilities that could emerge due to certain equipment failures.</li>
<li><strong>Fire suppression system failure</strong>: Should a fire start in a secured area and the fire suppression system were to fail, procedures should exist to minimize the overall damage, if possible. It may be possible for technicians to only power-off all equipment and exit the facility.</li>
<li><strong>Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) failure</strong>: The severity of this event depends on the location of the facility. In areas where temperatures and humidity are typically high, an HVAC failure could result in serious heat damage to computing equipment. On the other hand, in an extremely cold situation, the loss of heat could degrade the performance of critical components.</li>
<li><strong>Key personnel resignation/departure</strong>: Many organizations can't afford to have back-up personnel in place for every key position. When a valuable and hard-to-replace employee leaves the organization, especially if that employee was the one authority for certain activities, recovery from a security event may not be possible without additional help.</li>
<li><strong>Power outage/brown-out</strong>: We all know the threat of losing electrical power service to a building, wing, room, or circuit and the operational interruptions that go with it. Frequent power outages (black-outs), which typically involve a power sag followed by a power surge, and brown-outs or periods of low power voltage can degrade the performance and efficiency of a computer's power supply and eventually cause the device to fail.</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>Physical security threats tend to involve a human in one form or another, but typically because the human takes advantage of a technical vulnerability or opportunity created from a procedural gap. Some examples of technical threats are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access beyond authorization</strong>: <em>It happens!</em> An unsuspecting network user logs into the system and finds that he or she suddenly has access to confidential data that was unavailable to them before. Should the user inform system administration, an investigation and corrective action can take place. However, if it's not reported, an audit and review of user and group account permissions and rights should be immediate, as well as periodical.</li>
<li><strong>Intruder attacks</strong>: The attack surface of a computer network are the external points of entry or the internal access points that external and internal threat agents can exploit. An <strong>intrusion</strong> <strong>detection system</strong> (<strong>IDS</strong>), an <strong>intrusion prevention system</strong> (<strong>IPS</strong>), or a hybrid device that combines detection and prevention can detect or prevent, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware failure</strong>: Depending on the hardware component that fails, the failure can impact production, security, or both. For example, the failure of an authentication server or the malfunction of a biometric device could create an exploitable vulnerability.</li>
<li><strong>Missing or inadequate operating procedures</strong>: Regardless of the event, whether a physical access event or a logical security event, if a clear up-to-date procedure doesn't exist to handle the situation, the action taken could cause additional damage or make the issue unrecoverable.</li>
<li><strong>Unauthorized modifications to software or hardware</strong>: Perhaps this should be a man-made threat, but, either way, unauthorized and undocumented changes to production software or hardware could create a variety of physical or logical security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Server+ certification exam references a variety of physical security concepts and countermeasures. The following lists those items or concepts specifically listed in the exam's objectives with a brief explanation or definition of each and its use in a physical security application:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Badges and cards</strong>: As we discussed earlier in this chapter, employee badges can include <strong>Radio-Frequency Identification</strong> (<strong>RFID</strong>) chips or other embedded circuitry that can be either a microcontroller with a small amount of memory or just a memory circuit that holds identifying data. Smartcards and PIVs are examples of this technology.</li>
<li><strong>Biometric devices</strong>: The most common PC-based biometric is a fingerprint scanner that's either a peripheral or built-in device. However, there are several physical security biometric devices that range from fingerprints and handprints patterns, hand and finger geometry, retinal and iris scanners, voice recognition, and vascular pattern scans that scan a hand to match the pattern of the internal blood veins.</li>
<li><strong>Lockable cabinets and safes</strong>: In a data center, certain removable media, forms (such as checks or order forms), hot swap components, and other essential items should be in a locked, and preferably fireproof cabinet or safe.</li>
<li><strong>Locks and keys</strong>: Perhaps the oldest physical security devices are door and other locks and the keys that open them. An extension of this technology are keypads on which a person seeking to enter an area keys in a security pass code.</li>
<li><strong>Mantrap</strong>: This is also known as an air lock or a sally port and provides an entry to a building or secured area with a small space, some call a room or vestibule, with interlocking doors on two sides that serve as an entry and an exit. The interlocking is such that only one door (or set of doors) can be open at any one time. Mantraps are common in areas where the external temperatures are far below or above the temperature inside a building or where some environmental or security procedure occurs between the two doors.</li>
<li><strong>Rack mount cabinet</strong>: In larger data centers, the computing and internetworking devices are rack-mounted frames and cabinets. See <a href="79e86743-32d3-4ae6-bc33-83018f475c12.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Server Hardware,</em> for more information on rack mount cabinets.</li>
<li><strong>Security cameras and sensors</strong>: Security cameras extend the field of vision for a security personnel (such as a security guard) who can monitor multiple camera images from a single location. A security camera may also provide an image stream for storage on magnetic medium for later review. Security sensors include motion detectors, which can activate other security devices, door and window opening sensors, glass breakage sensors, and a variety of other intrusion detection devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The temperature, humidity, and airflow in a data center or computing facility can be as much a part of a physical security program as door locks. One of the principles of system security is availability and the environment in which the computing devices and servers operate must support the efficient operation of all equipment. Environmental controls implement and maintain the best operating environment for the equipment and devices contained in each space. The various components of environmental controls include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HVAC</strong>: In addition to heating and cooling, an HVAC system must maintain a constant even temperature and humidity range for the entire data center. The HVAC system should also interconnect to the fire control system so that the airflow system doesn't continue to feed oxygen to a fire.</li>
<li><strong>Room, row, and rack temperatures</strong>: As discussed earlier in this book, large data centers commonly have rows of rack mount servers, power supplies, and network-attached storage in open racks or enclosed rack-mount cabinets. Because different devices have different cooling requirements, a row of racks may be a <em>cold</em> row or a <em>hot</em> row. The HVAC system can direct cooling to one row and warmer air to another using airflow baffles and rack-blanking panels that create open spaces between rack-mounted devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>A variety of measurable conditions and ongoing functions contribute to the environment of a computer server room or data center. This environment is a moving target because of changes in the external weather and environment, the housing facility's HVAC system, and those dedicated to the data center.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The conditions that an environmental monitoring system should detect and report include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature: </strong>Most environmental guidelines for computer rooms and data centers set the temperature range at 68 to 77 °F or 20 to 25 °C. Keeping the ambient temperature below or above this range for extended periods of time can damage the electronic components.</li>
<li><strong>Humidity</strong>: Depending on where a data center is located, humidity can be a problem of being too high or too low. An environment with high humidity may see oxidation and corrosion of electronic circuits and components. At the other extreme, low humidity may generate problems from static electricity. The standard recommendation for the relative humidity in a data center is 45 percent to 55 percent.</li>
<li><strong>Voltage and power</strong>: Voltage sensors and power-monitoring sensors monitoring electrical power voltage levels and power consumption against predefined high and low limits, brown outs, and power outages. Events measured to be too high or too low, and for too long, trigger a variety of alerts.</li>
<li><strong>Physical intrusion</strong>: Data center doors that remain locked during normal operating times should have open or ajar alarms installed. These alarms let the data center staff know that a door is open and a breach may be in progress.</li>
<li><strong>Smoke</strong>: As the saying goes, <em>Where there's smoke, there's fire.</em> Smoke and carbon monoxide fumes can be dangerous to people working in the data center. Smoke alarms and chemical detectors that interconnect to the power system and the environmental monitoring and alerting system can shut down the power and trigger alerts in the event it detects smoke or fumes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without electrical power, at least to this point in time, there would be no computers. Maybe someday, computers may run on air or banana skins, such as a Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor flux capacitor, but, for now, they're electrical devices powered by a connection to the power grid or by a battery. In this chapter, since we are looking at physical security, we'll focus on the power sources to computers and how it's best managed.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Safeguarding the electrical supply to a data center facility is another important consideration for a physical security program. However, a physical security plan should recognize that typically an UPS protects individual computers and peripherals adequately. The basic operating function of a UPS system is to pass an AC mains power source through to AC-powered devices, while charging a battery with DC power.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of a UPS, whether a standalone or a multi-faceted data center UPS, is to level out power surges and slumps and provide electrical power in the event of a loss of electrical service. Constant power fluctuations and failures can damage or destroy electrical components and may even cause the data center to fail its SLA. When a UPS senses an electrical power event is occurring, it initiates the mitigating action required. This could be to knock down an electrical spike, enhance a power slump, or switch to battery power to counter an outage.</p>
<p>In general, a UPS has multiple internal circuits and a battery:</p>
<ul>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The circuitry of an online UPS</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>There are two primary types of UPS—<strong>offline</strong> and <strong>online</strong>. An offline UPS, also known as a standby UPS, passes the AC mains power to its own AC outlets. When the AC power source is constant, the UPS passes it through to its output electrical outlets, drawing off only enough to charge its battery. Should the AC mains source drop, the offline UPS uses an inverter to convert the stored DC into AC.</p>
<p>An online UPS, illustrated in the preceding diagram uses a rectifier to convert the AC mains power into DC, which stabilizes the current and charges its batteries. The UPS then converts the DC power into clean and stable AC power. Online UPS systems provide constant AC power without breaks in the power stream, even when the power source drops.</p>

<p>Typically, UPS ratings are in either maximum <strong>volt-ampere</strong> (<strong>VA</strong>), maximum wattage, or both. These values indicate the upper limit of the capabilities of a UPS's, and the power demand on it shouldn't exceed these ratings. The rule of thumb for sizing a UPS for smaller power demands, such as a single computer, is that the wattage rating shouldn't exceed roughly 60 percent of the VA rating. However, on larger systems, it's common that the wattage and the VA ratings are equal.</p>
<p>Two other rating values that indicate the performance of a UPS are capacity and runtime. Capacity is the maximum amount of VA a UPS can output. Runtime, which is dependent on the size of the UPS battery, is the length of time the UPS can provide sufficient power to connected devices.</p>

<p>Some UPS units can issue shutdown commands to connected devices, which can prevent data or processing losses; a panic-mode activity to shutdown servers and storage devices safely; or a lengthy system restoration. There are two ways to implement this capability—connecting a UPS to a network by adding a network adapter to the UPS or connecting a UPS to each of the devices should mains power drop.</p>

<p>The power supply unit is perhaps the most important component of a PC! This statement is certainly debatable, but consider that, without it, a PC is a bunch of plastic and metal that could be a boat's anchor or a very large paperweight. The power supply unit converts mains AC 120 volts or 240 volts electricity into a DC current typically 3.3 and 5 volts for internal circuits and 12 volts for internally mounted peripherals, such as disk drives, and cooling fans.</p>
<p>Power supplies are essential in desktop, tower, and portable computers. However, rack-or-cabinet mounted systems, such as servers, disk drives, and inter-networking devices, such as routers, switches, and firewalls, maximize computing power while minimizing the floor space required. Most of these devices require an external power source, which is either dedicated to a specific device or shared by several devices. In either case, the external power distribution device is a <strong>power distribution unit</strong> (<strong>PDU</strong>):</p>

<p>Power strips or surge suppressors are common to home and office systems. However, while some PDUs may look like a power strip, there are differences. A PDU, like a power strip, has multiple electric outlets and a mains power cord that connects the unit to an AC wall outlet, UPS, or another electric service distribution device. PDUs are common power units for devices installed in a rack or cabinet.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>A PDU distributes electricity through multiple outlets on two primary device styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Floor-mounted</strong>: This PDU converts raw electrical power sources (unconditioned AC power) into multiple lower-voltage electrical outlets. Floor-mounted PDUs are typically standalone units that power multiple devices, racks, or cabinets.</li>
<li><strong>Rack-mounted</strong>: This PDU provides mains electrical power to multiple outlets. Some rack-mounted PDUs include monitoring and control capabilities that can administrator can remotely access to track the power supply.</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>PDUs are available in seven configurations, some of which are floor-mounted or rack-mounted units:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard (basic) PDU</strong>: This PDU type is commonly a power outlet strip placed between a power source, such as a UPS, power generator, or a mains outlet, and a wiring closet, data center, or individual racks or cabinets. It typically has multiple low-amp outlets and is used to provide power to multiple rack-mounted devices.</li>
<li><strong>Metered PDU</strong>: This rack-mounted PDU type includes a digital current meter that monitors the electrical load to avoid power surge and overloads.</li>
<li><strong>Monitored PDU</strong>: This is another rack-mounted PDU that adds the capability to monitor electrical sources through a network connection to the functions of a metered PDU.</li>
<li><strong>Switched PDU</strong>: Also known as a switched-rack PDU, this rack-mounted PDU combines the functionality of a monitored PDU with the capability to turn on or turn off individual outlets to reboot devices over a network.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) PDU</strong>: This PDU type can have two (or more) independent power sources. In the event of a loss of power on one source, an ATS PDU can switch automatically to the back-up power source.</li>
<li><strong>Hot-swap PDU</strong>: Like an ATS PDU, this PDU type connects to two different power sources so that, when needed, a manual switch can change between the input power sources without a break in power.</li>
<li><strong>Dual circuit PDU</strong>: In effect, this type of PDU is equivalent to having two PDUs in one unit, which saves on space and provides redundancy, and supports devices with dual power supplies.</li>

<p>In the US, the input power source to a PDU is generally either a single or a three-phase 208 V. Without going into too much detail, the difference between a three-phase and a single-phase electrical service is the number of cable wires supplying power. A single-phase circuit uses one of its two <em>hot</em> 120V wires and a neutral to provide a single 120 V charge, as shown in the following diagram. A three-phase cable has three hot 120V wires and a neutral wire. As shown in the following diagram, any single wire and the neutral can provide the equivalent of a single-phase circuit. More commonly, two of the hot wires combine to provide 208V:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1070 image-border" src="Images/3cf09ddc-65fb-40b9-9b53-74e7f081eceb.jpg" style="width:35.58em;height:18.33em;" width="719" height="371"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"> A comparison of the structures of single-and three-phase circuits</div>
<p>In larger data centers and server rooms, three-phase power is the most commonly used. Single-phase power is typical in a home or small office environment.</p>
<p>The capabilities of a PDU fall into two general classifications—power ratings and load capacity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power rating</strong>: Power ratings are in amperes, volts, and watts. These ratings indicate the characteristics of the electrical power provided by the PDU. Amperes indicate the strength of the electric current available at each of the PDU's outlets. Voltage measures the pressure required to move the amperes through a circuit, cable, or wire. In the US, voltage ratings are either 110V or 120V. The watts rating specifies the electrical power available to meet the demands of the device connected to the PDU.</li>
<li><strong>Load capacity</strong>: A PDU should match the power requirements of the devices it is to service. The load capacity of a PDU is the maximum amount of power a PDU can support. For example, a single rack-mounted server may require an operating range of 600 to 900 watts of power, which translates into a range of 5 to 7.5A. It's recommended that the demand on a PDU outlet not exceed more than 80 percent of its capacity. This means that the load on a 20-amp outlet shouldn't exceed 16 amps. See the following table for an illustration of these calculations:</li>

<p>Data centers and server rooms must be secure and safe environments and workspaces. There are a variety of guidelines and standards that list the requirements for a creating a functional, safe, and secure area. The following are space and safety requirements for server rooms and data centers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: The area or room that houses the servers, internetworking devices, UPS, PDU, and possibly cooling equipment, distribution panels, and cabling, should provide clearances between or among the equipment to allow for maintenance, servicing, installation or removal, and general passage. The aisles between devices, racks, or cabinets should be a minimum of 3.2 feet (1 meter), but racks and cabinets should have 4 feet to the front and 3 feet to the back of minimum clearance. Where one row of racks or cabinets is behind another, the front and back clearances should all be 4 feet. Entrance and exit access should be in accordance with local ordinances.</li>
<li><strong>Lighting</strong>: In a server room or data center of any size, all electronic equipment should be well lighted for safety and to provide a good working area. Lighting should illuminate both the fronts and backs of racks and cabinets, as well as the devices inside the unit. Emergency lighting should be in place to provide for a safe exit in the event of a power outage.</li>
<li><strong>Electrical safety</strong>: The electrical density of a server room or data center shouldn't exceed 300 watts per square foot of floorspace, on average. PDU and UPS units in the server room shouldn't exceed a rating of 100 kVA and, if larger, should be in a separate space.</li>
<li><strong>Fire safety</strong>: An enclosed server room or data center should have a fire suppression system and all cabling in the space should have a fire-rating or plenum. Fire extinguishers should be readily available.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Only authorized employees or vendors should have access to the server room or data center. Log file entries record entries into and exits from the space. As an emergency precaution, this space should also have at least one communication device for making contact outside the space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Larger server rooms and data centers typically install raised flooring if for no other reason than to run the cabling for the installed devices under the floor surface. However, a raised floor, installed on a grid frame and filled in with flooring tiles, can't support the same weight as a concrete slab floor. Raised flooring, for all intents and purposes, is just as permanent as the concrete slab, which means that, as the enterprise grows and the computing equipment expands, the weight on the floor tends to increase.</p>
<p>There are three primary load types (weight measures) for raised flooring:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Point load</strong>: This is the weight of an object on any one of its supports. For example, if a rack cabinet sits on four caster wheels, the point load for that cabinet is the weight on any one of the wheels. The flooring must be able to support the point load of the heaviest device or cabinet that will occupy the space.</li>
<li><strong>Static load</strong>: This is the combined total of all of the point loads on a specific tile. If two (or more) cabinets have a leg or wheel on one floor tiles, the static load is the total of the point loads for those units.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling load</strong>: Typically, this factor applies to perforated floor tiles and represents the weight of a piece of equipment or a rack cabinet moving over a tile. The rolling load on a tile is the total of two point loads of the device.</li>
</ul>

<p>MFA combines two or more factors to authenticate a user. MFA uses five authentication factors: something you know, something you have, something you are, somewhere you are, and something you do.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Physical security is based on an organization's security policies and plans. A physical security program should address the following—physical safeguards, vulnerabilities and threats, monitoring systems, service and utility interruptions, and unauthorized entry, vandalism, or theft. Physical security should focus on deterrence to prevent security events and detection measures to discover events threatening the organization. Threats have four general categories—environmental, man-made, site-specific, and technical.</p>
<p>Environmental controls are a part of physical security. Server and networking devices can have a variety of cooling requirements, such as cold rows or hot rows. Environmental monitoring system should detect and report: temperature, humidity, voltage and power, physical intrusion, and smoke and chemical fumes.</p>
<p>A physical security plan includes UPS units to protect computers and peripherals. A UPS passes utility power to AC outlets and charges an internal DC battery. An offline UPS passes AC mains power through a bypass circuit to its AC outlets, while also charging its battery. An online UPS converts AC power into DC then converts the DC into AC power. The ratings of UPS units are in VA, watts, capacity, and runtime.</p>
<p>Many rack-mounted devices require an external power source, which is commonly a PDU. A PDU has multiple AC outlets and a power cord that connects to an AC outlet. PDUs are either floor-mounted or rack-mounted. PDUs are available in seven configurations: standard, metered, monitored, switched, automatic transfer switch, hot-swap, and dual circuit. PDU ratings also address power ratings and load capacity.</p>
<p>Data centers and server rooms must be secure and safe environments and workspaces. The guidelines and standards for a creating a functional, safe, and secure area are as follows: space, lighting, electrical safety, fire safety, and security. Server rooms commonly have raised flooring, which has three load types—point load, static load, and rolling load.</p>
