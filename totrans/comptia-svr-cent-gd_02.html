<p>It's generally assumed that a computer network server, at least in the way we talk about it, is hardware first and software second. While it's easier to envision a computer as a network server, in fact, the server is a piece of software running on the computer. In its most strict definition, a server is anything that provides services to fulfill requests made to it. Therefore, someone who takes our order and brings us our meal in a restaurant is a server and, in the same way, software running on a computer that processes an SQL request on a database and returns the data to the requester is also a server. Regardless of the way you envision a server, for the sake of learning about servers, let's agree that a centralized computer running server software that provides services to a network is a server.</p>
<p>With that understanding, let's look at the various roles fulfilled by a computer network server and the hardware of a typical computer in the role of a server.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server roles</li>
<li>Form factors</li>
<li>Server power systems</li>
<li>System heat</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root">The software running on a server defines the role of that server. In fact, a server can have two or more different roles at times; it depends on the software. The list of the different roles a server can fulfill is long, but for the purposes of the Server+ exam, you should know the role and function of each of the following server types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application server</li>
<li>Database server</li>
<li>Directory server</li>
<li>File server</li>
<li>Mail server</li>
<li>Messaging server</li>
<li>Network services server</li>
<li>Print server</li>
<li>Routing and remote access server</li>
<li>Web server</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">The following sections explain each of these server roles.</p>

<p class="mce-root">In the current environment of web-enabled or <strong>Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) applications in the cloud, an application server functions much like the generic description given above. An application server often provides services for one or more applications and serves as a mid-level service between user requests and other server- or network-based functions, such as a database system . There are three basic types of application servers. Their differences lie in what they do and where they fit into a process. The three types of application servers are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LAN application servers</strong>: This type of application server can exist internally within an organization's local network and provide data-processing support to network users on one or more applications. They may host an entire application's processing or share the processing with a user's computer. A common implementation of this type of application server is a three-tier client/server environment in which the application server is middle-ware between a network user and a database management system. The following diagram illustrates a three-tier client/server system:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-918 image-border" src="Images/655e7889-0ad4-4b2a-9269-2862d542fd77.jpg" style="width:28.08em;height:11.67em;" width="883" height="366"/></p>
<div class="mce-root packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">In a three-tier client/server system, an application server provides services to both the user and a database management system or other function-specific servers</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query-based application servers</strong><span>:</span> This type of application server hosts one or more scripting or programming language services used to request data from a database. A user's computer may have an active dashboard, a status board, or a specific scripting or service request system, such as <strong>Active Server Page</strong> (<strong>ASP</strong>), <strong>JavaServer Pages</strong> (<strong>JSP</strong>), Django, or Ruby on Rails. The application server accesses a database and returns current or real-time data back to the client software.</li>
<li><strong>Application/web servers</strong>: In many cases, application servers are becoming web servers and vice versa. Either type of server can support <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>HTTP</strong>) request-and-response traffic and interact with client browsers. A stand alone web server (also called an HTTP server) typically includes several specialized scripts and database query services in addition to performing basic web server duties. A web-enabled application server includes the capability to deliver web content to a client's browser. Examples of web/application servers are IBM WebSphere, Oracle iPlanet, and Apache Tomcat, and Microsoft <strong>Internet Information Services</strong> (<strong>IIS</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root">As shown in the preceding diagram, in the <em>Application servers</em> section, a database server provides an interface between client requests, either directly or through an application server, and a database management system and its database. In most cases, an application server passes data requests to the database server for the processing and retrieval of the requested data. The database server then returns the data back to the requesting node. In a database client/server environment, the database management system, which performs the input/output operations on the database, is the backend. The software running on a host computer or an application server is the frontend. Requests for data flow from the frontend to the backend and back again.</p>

<p class="mce-root">A directory server supports directory services. Okay, <em>but what are directory services?</em> <em>Have you ever entered the lobby of a very tall building and used the directory board to locate where in the building the person or organization was that you needed to find?</em> Typically, you'd find the name, which has the location on the same line. <em>Sound familiar?</em> Directory services cross-reference or map the names, designations, or locations of computer or network resources to their respective local or network addresses.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The resources identified and addressed typically include disk volumes, directories, folders, files, input devices, output devices, and any other devices attached or installed on a system. This service is essential in a network. With this information, a resource is located, used, and administered. Without directory services, network resource addressing would be like a town in which the houses don't have street addresses. Efficient network operations would be impossible. Directory services are also known as name services because they manage a namespace. A <strong>namespace</strong> is a data abstraction that holds a list of names or identities of system resources, in this case, and their network addresses or locations. The namespace allows users, applications, and other services to access resources without the need to know their locations in advance. A directory server, or name server, is a server application that provides the organization, management, and security of the directory or name services, for example, Microsoft Active Directory, Red Hat Directory Server, Lotus Domino.</p>

<p class="mce-root">A file server is just what its name suggests—a server for files. There are several different types of file servers, but in general, a file server provides data resources to other nodes on a network. The configuration of a file server is a combination of several factors, including storage capacity, access time, security, fault tolerance, and, of course, budget. To best serve the data needs of an organization, a file server must be set up with the right blend of these factors. File servers can serve one of two roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated file servers</strong>: This type of file server expressly provides file or database content to clients. A dedicated file server serves in that capacity only.</li>
<li><strong>Non-dedicated file servers</strong>: This type of file server supports two or more server services or functions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">What defines each of these roles is the method used for data sharing. File servers can be a <strong>File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>FTP</strong>) server, a <strong>Service Message Block</strong>/<strong>Common Internet File System</strong> (<strong>SMB</strong>/<strong>CIFS</strong>) protocol server, an HTTP server, or a <strong>Network File System</strong> (<strong>NFS</strong>) server. Another form of file server arrangement is a <strong>network-attached storage</strong> (<strong>NAS</strong>) system.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Mail servers, which are also known as <strong>email servers</strong> or <strong>mail transport agent</strong> (<strong>MTA</strong>), process and transport electronic mail messages for a network, up to and including the internet. A mail server emulates the functions of human postal workers in that it receives incoming mail and forwards it on to its destination, typically another mail server. The two primary protocols involved with mail servers and the delivery of emails are the <strong>Simple Message Transport Protocol</strong> (<strong>SMTP</strong>) and the <strong>Post Office Protocol 3</strong> (<strong>POP3</strong>). SMTP transports messages between mail servers. POP3 is a client-based protocol that interacts with a mail server to send and receive messages addressed to a particular user.</p>

<p class="mce-root">A messaging server is a middleware service that receives, forwards, or holds messages between client applications and services. These messages communicate requests, responses, and status updates between client processes running on a network. There are two primary types of messaging servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Point-to-point messaging servers</strong>: This type of messaging is a communication between one client, through a messaging server, and a single addressee client. Although other clients may be monitoring the messaging channel, only the single client to which the message is addressed will receive the message. An example of a point-to-point messaging service is the Java message service.</li>
<li><strong>Publish-subscribe messaging servers</strong>: This type of messaging communicates a message from a client (the publisher), through the messaging server, to a messaging category that includes multiple subscribed clients. The subscribers indicate which message categories they wish to receive. The clients then receive messages from only the categories to which they have subscribed. An example of publish-subscribe messaging services are Faye, NATS, and Redis.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root">Although the <strong>network operating system</strong> (<strong>NOS</strong>) provides most network services, protocols, and services such as the <strong>Domain Name System</strong> (<strong>DNS</strong>), the <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong> (<strong>DHCP</strong>), instant messaging, <strong>Voice over Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong>VoIP</strong>), <strong>Network Time Protocol</strong> (<strong>NTP</strong>), and email can run from a centralized network services server.</p>

<p class="mce-root">A print server is a device (a computer, appliance, or software) that accepts print requests from clients and provides the sequencing and management of a network-attached printer, plotter, or other imaging device. A printer attached to a desktop computer directly can manage the print function through a print queue, typically on a first-come-first-served basis. On a network, with any number of clients requesting print services, access to a printer can be contentious at times. In addition to managing a network's print queue, a print server can also manage or enforce print policies, such as volume, color printing, and others. Today's print servers are stand-alone network devices dedicated to the single function of printing. The following diagram illustrates a wireless network that includes a print server:</p>

<p class="mce-root">Proxy servers are intermediate network services that accept network client requests for resources from remote servers. A proxy server examines a client's request and determines the most efficient way of providing the requested resource. Client requests can be for a service, a file, or a web page, among other network-based resources. In today's networks, proxy servers are web proxies that provide several functions, such as reducing network traffic, concealing a requester's identity, and, getting past IP address blocking. A proxy server doesn't necessarily require a centralized network computer to operate. A proxy server may be on one or more users' workstations, one server on a network, or at several points in between. The location of the proxy server isn't nearly as important as its capability to connect a user's workstation to the sought-after servers on the internet. There are several types of proxy servers, each of which provides a primary service. The most common types of proxy servers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gateway proxy servers</strong>: This type of proxy server, also known as <strong>application-level gateways</strong> or <strong>tunneling proxy servers</strong>, serve as portals between a local network and the internet, sending and receiving unchanged client requests and the resulting responses.</li>
<li><strong>Internet-facing (forward) proxy servers</strong>: This type of proxy server facilitate requests from their internal networks for resources from the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Open proxy servers</strong>: These are forward proxy servers that will send request-and-response messages to or from anywhere on an inter-network.</li>
<li><strong>Internal-facing proxy servers</strong>: This type of proxy server provides several ways to protect and service their internal networks. Reverse proxies can perform authentication, authorization, caching, decryption, and load balancing.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse proxy servers</strong>: A common use for internal-facing proxy servers is as reverse proxy servers. This type of proxy server accepts requests from the internet, such as HTTP requests, and passes them to the appropriate internal network server for processing.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root">Anything virtual is like something, but it's not really it. So, a <strong>virtual server</strong> is like a server, without being one. Well, almost. A virtual server is a software-enabled logic object operating in the memory of a physical computer. A single physical computer can support several virtual servers, provided it has the hardware resources, primarily memory, to do so. As illustrated in the following diagram, a physical computer can support one, two, or even more virtual servers. In addition to the hardware and the appropriate device drivers, the virtualization layer, known as a <strong>hypervisor</strong>, provides direct support to the virtual servers, each of which occupies a shell in memory. Each virtual server can support numerous virtual machines, installed on the same host hardware or on other network computers:</p>

<p class="mce-root">It's common, especially in smaller networks and some home networks, to use a single tower computer as the network server. Tower computers, like the one shown in the following image, are inside a standing case or cabinet. Towers are commonly network servers. This means that a tower computer tends to have more different components and connectors than a <strong>Small Office</strong>/<strong>Home Office</strong> (<strong>SOHO</strong>) computer, even one in a tower case:</p>

<p class="mce-root">The computer hardware on which a server runs fits into a slim chassis mounted in a rack system. The rack itself is typically either a two- or four-rail vertical structure. A server, or other rack-mounted device, attaches to the vertical rails using a rail kit, which consists of horizontally-mounted rails on which the device sits, and the fasteners to attach both to the vertical struts. The cabling that attaches to the rear of the rack-mounted device may install on a cable management arm, which helps to 1) organize the cabling on the device, and 2) allow the cabling to be out of the way when servicing or performing an upgrade on the unit. The height of a rack-mountable device is in rack units (U's). A rack unit is 1.75 inches (44.45 millimeters) tall. The size of a rack-mountable device is in the number of U's it will occupy in a vertical rack. The following diagram illustrates the relative sizes of a <strong>1U</strong>, <strong>2U</strong>, <strong>3U</strong>, and a <strong>4U</strong> half-rack mount. Servers are most commonly <strong>1U</strong> or <strong>2U</strong> in size:</p>

<p class="mce-root">A blade server enclosure houses server blades, each of which is a scaled-down computer that fits into a slot in the rack-mountable blade enclosure chassis. The aim of the blade's design is to reduce the physical size, the number of direct interfaces, and the overall power usage of the server system. To do this, each blade has the components required to perform its internal processing. The cooling, power, networking, cabling, and management systems are a part of the blade enclosure or supplied by other devices in the rack mount or cabinet. As shown in the following image, a blade server enclosure supports several server blades. Each of the server blades installed in the blade server is, in fact, a discrete server that has a processor, memory, network adapter, and a <strong>host bus adapter</strong> (<strong>HBA</strong>). It's common for a server blade to only support one application or service:</p>

<p class="mce-root">The power requirements of a server system, regardless of its form, are higher than needed by a desktop or laptop computer. Gilster's law (of everything computing) says:</p>
<div class="mce-root packt_quote">"You never can tell, and it all depends."</div>
<p class="mce-root">This pretty much sums up the power and cooling systems for servers. The amount of power required by a server, measured in watts, is determined by the components installed and the devices attached to it. The same goes for cooling. The amount and kind of cooling required is a function of the heat generated by the components under power. However, whether the server is a stand alone computer or a blade server in a data center, the device power and cooling systems must provide a sufficient level of service to power and ventilate its components. The challenge in choosing and installing the right equipment for these tasks is anticipating growth in the systems or increased demand for these services. The de facto form factor standard for network servers is the standard-ATX (shown earlier, in the image published in the <em>Form factors </em>section). The ATX standard sets the form, fit, and function of a server's major components, primarily the motherboard, <strong>power supply unit</strong> (<strong>PSU</strong>), and case. This ensures that these components are compatible and interoperable.</p>

<p class="mce-root">The primary function of a PSU is to convert an <strong>alternating current</strong> (<strong>AC</strong>) or a <strong>direct current</strong> (<strong>DC</strong>) into the low-voltage DC that powers the server's internal components. In North America, the predominant domestic electrical service is 120V AC (referred to as 110V), which has an actual range of 115V to 127V. The rest of the world (and some commercial data centers elsewhere, including the US) have a DC mains power standard of 230V, +/- 10%. In the US, the output voltage from a PSU conforms to the ATX standard of +3.3VDC, +5VDC, and +/- 12VDC, regardless of the electrical input. Because voltages can and do vary within a range, some systems use different numbers, although they designate similar systems. For example, the standard household voltage in the US is 120V AC. Notice that, in the following table, a 120V in the <strong>Wye voltage</strong> column can also supply 208V or 240V, depending on the circuit's connections:</p>

<p class="mce-root">There are two standard configurations used in electrical circuit diagrams—<strong>wye</strong> and <strong>delta</strong>. These names describe the approximate shape each has in a circuit diagram. A wye configuration connects a current-bearing line to a neutral in a sort of <em>Y</em> pattern. A delta configuration connects two current-bearing lines together to create a triangular shape. The easy way to remember these is that a wye circuit uses a neutral and a delta circuit doesn't.</p>

<p class="mce-root">The voltage standard in telecommunications signaling, including wireless networking, is negative 48V power. All electrical circuits operate with plus (positive) and minus (negative) polarities, which yields one <em>live</em> side and one <em>ground</em> side. The 110V and 230V systems connect the grounding connection to the negative (minus) side. Negative 48V power connects its ground to the positive (plus) side. In case you're wondering why telecom systems use a negative voltage standard, it's because this voltage is safer for humans, especially those climbing up telephone poles.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Let's look at server power systems from the inside out, starting with the PSU mounted inside the server case. PSU modules are usually installed on the system case during manufacturing. However, because PSUs are the number one failure point in a computer system of any size, even those PSUs attached during manufacturing, are replaceable. The power needs of a server are dependent on its size and its installed or attached components. As the number of disk drives, network adapters, and RAM grows, the amount of electrical power a server needs also increases. A server's PSU needs to be more robust and operationally efficient than a standard PSU included in a typical desktop or portable computer. Because servers are essential to networks, they must be available, meaning that their power supply unit must continuously and consistently provide the voltage needed to power the server.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Most of the power supplies available on the market, except those from the more <em>reputable</em> manufacturers, can have inferior components and claim overstated performance numbers. Although it is only one measure of a power supply's capabilities, many computer users rely on only the wattage rating of a PSU as the deciding factor for choosing one. Manufacturers understand that the wattage of a PSU is important to consumers, so they make sure it is very visible on the packaging and on the unit itself, as shown in the following image:</p>

<p class="mce-root">The 80-plus program is a voluntary certification of computer PSUs based on their electrical efficiency. The <em>80</em> represents the quality threshold set as a minimum standard for operating efficiency at various load levels. Six levels of certification are available, based on the level of the unit's performance. Products that meet the requirements of each of the certification levels can include a badge on their packaging, marketing, and product labels, as shown in the subsequent image. The first level is the basic 80-plus certification (called <em>White</em>), which verifies that a PSU is 80 percent efficient under 20, 50, and 100 percent loads. The mid-level is <em>Gold</em>, which certifies units as having at least 87 percent efficiency at the three loads. The highest level is <em>Titanium</em> which verifies a unit with efficiencies above 90 percent under all load levels. This following image shows the various certifications of the 80-plus program:</p>

<p class="mce-root">There are several factors that you should consider when selecting a power supply for a server, beyond how much wattage you need. The following lists the characteristics and capabilities that you should consider when selecting the PSU that's right for your server:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wattage</strong>: This number represents the power demands the server will make of the PSU as measured in watts. There are several wattage calculators on the web (see the following screenshot) that you can use to determine the total wattage your server needs. It's recommended that you add the wattage for any planned server or network expansions in your initial calculations:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937 image-border" src="Images/7af7b35d-2020-4123-9736-81b1e0b495c6.jpg" style="width:69.00em;height:44.92em;" width="828" height="539"/></p>
<div class="mce-root packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"> A web-based interactive power supply calculator<br/>
Image courtesy: eXtreme Outer Vision, LLC</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectors and modularity</strong>: Make sure that the connectors provided with the PSU are compatible with the components that are to be attached and interconnected with it. A modular PSU has no built-in cables, only receptacles. This minimizes the amount of cabling on the PSU to only those that are necessary, which reduces clutter. Non-modular PSUs have different numbers and types of standard connectors. The connectors common to most current PSUs are:
<ul>
<li>ATX 24-pin or ATX 20+4-pin main power cable connector</li>
<li>8-pin <strong>entry-level power supply</strong> (<strong>EPS</strong>) +12 volt </li>
<li>4+4-pin +12 volt power cable connector</li>
<li>6-pin <strong>PCI express</strong> (<strong>PCIe</strong>) </li>
<li>8-pin PCIe </li>
<li>6+2-pin PCIe power cable connector</li>
<li>4-pin peripheral power cable connector</li>
<li>SATA power cable connector</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High-efficiency rating</strong>: The 80-plus certification is an excellent guideline, but you should verify a PSU's efficiency rating as having been set from testing under actual load simulation. An 80% rating means that 20% of a PSU's energy (wattage) escapes as heat.</li>
<li><strong>Rails</strong>: In the context of a PSU, a rail is an output current of a single voltage. For example, an ATX PSU has one 3.3V rail, two for 5V (one each for +/- 5V), two for 12V (one each for +/- 12V), and a 5V standby rail.</li>
<li><strong>External connection</strong>: It may sound trivial, but without an external power cable with the appropriate connectors for your location (country), all your careful planning and selecting will have been for nothing. If you are in the US, use a <strong>National Electrical Manufacturers Association</strong> (<strong>NEMA</strong>) standards power cord and plugs. NEMA 5-15P connectors are the most commonplace in the US. In situations such as data centers with higher power ratings, a more robust connection can be wise. In these situations, a twist-lock connector such as the NEMA 5-30R locks the plug head into the electrical outlet.</li>
<li><strong>Voltage switching</strong>: Many PSUs include a voltage sensor that automatically detects the electrical current and switches to its voltage and mode. However, not all PSUs have this capability—some have a manual switch, and some have no switch at all and support only a single electrical service.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root">One way to ensure that a server or server cluster is fault-tolerant and provides high availability is to incorporate a redundant power supply system. Redundant power systems provide a safety net should the active power supply fail. In its most basic form, a redundant power supply has two separate PSUs that can provide power to the server together, alternatively, or with one PSU active and the other in standby mode. The image in this section shows a four-unit redundant power supply. The transition between the redundant units uses one of three configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OR</strong>: OR is a mathematical process that chooses between two (or more) options, as in <em>either or</em>. In this configuration, two PSUs can either share the power-load duties or one of the PSUs can be in standby mode. In either case, when a <strong>metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor</strong> (<strong>MOSFET</strong>) senses a drop in the power output of a unit, it switches to the standby PSU.</li>
<li><strong>N+1</strong>: The N+1 switch-over method is common for redundant systems that have three or more power supplies. In this arrangement, the +1 PSU is the standby unit and the N units share the power conversion operation.</li>
<li><strong>OR of N+1</strong>: This method is common to PSU blade systems. Each blade is a part of an N+1 grouping and interconnected to two or more power buses. Like the other redundancy configurations, each N+1 grouping can share power conversion or be in standby mode:</li>

<p class="mce-root">All electronic devices produce heat. Some do so more than others, and cooling must reduce the heat effect to avoid failure or intermittent problems. The electronic components found inside a server (mostly on the motherboard) that produce significant heat include microprocessors, <strong>graphics processing units</strong> (<strong>GPUs</strong>), chipsets, RAM, and <strong>voltage regulator modules</strong> (<strong>VRMs</strong>). Of these, microprocessors (CPUs) and GPUs produce most of the heat inside a server. High heat conditions or a condition called <strong>thermal stress</strong> can affect the service life or operations of electronic components. Physics tells us that when things get hot, they expand, and when they cool off, they contract. Any electronic component that continuously goes through heat and cool cycles, meaning expansion and contraction, is stressed, which can lead to performance issues. The bigger the difference between how hot hot is and how cool cool is relates directly to the severity of the damage done. Most newer computer systems and processors now carry a rating called <strong>thermal design power</strong> (<strong>TDP</strong>), which represents the amount of heat produced by the system or unit. The following table lists a few examples of the maximum TDP rating of several processors. This value indicates the amount of heat the cooling system must dissipate to keep the system running as it should. Although there are no standards for interpreting TDP, a lower value indicates the power usage and the heat produced is lower. TDP is only a general indicator of a system's cooling needs.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Computers, regardless of shape, form, size, or application, require a cooling system. In desktops, towers, and some laptops, the cooling system is inside the case. For a blade server, the cooling may be in the blade cabinet, the rack cabinet, or in the computer room overall. Several different methods are available to cool the internal components of a computer system. Some of these systems are legacy and some are new. For the Server+ exam, you should understand the cooling systems described in the following sections.</p>

<p class="mce-root">A basic air-cooling system is typically a default system built into a computer's case and internal components. In its simplest form, an air-cooling system consists of a <strong>heat sink</strong>, <strong>thermal paste</strong>, and the computer's <strong>case fan</strong>. A heat sink attaches directly to a CPU with a small amount of thermal paste between the two to provide a thermal conductor. Air gaps between the heat sink and the CPU can act as thermal insulators, so the thermal paste eliminates this possibility. The heat sink is a ribbed metal extrusion that extends the surface of the CPU to allow more air to dissipate the heat. Air flow from one or more case fans moves across the fins of the heat sink to carry the heat away. This type of heat dissipation is known as <strong>passive cooling</strong>. Adding baffles, or air flow defectors, to passive cooling systems to specifically direct the air flow can enhance the effectiveness of the air-cooling system.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Some upper-end cases include not only multiple fans (two or more case fans and a graphics card fan), but a baffle system that directs the airflow to the CPU and other hots spots in the case. The alternative to cooling a computer with air flow is <strong>liquid cooling</strong>, which uses a coolant to pull the heat away from the CPU. Liquid cooling applies the thermodynamic principle that heat from a warm object will move to a cooler object. A CPU liquid cooling system works like the cooling system in an automobile. A liquid coolant, in this case distilled water, is pumped through an attachment on the CPU. The coolness of the water draws the heat of the CPU away and dissipates in the air flow.</p>

<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, you learned that the software running on a computer establishes its role as the server. A server can provide a variety of services to a network's clients, including: application servers, file servers, mail servers, messaging servers, network servers, print servers, RRAS, and web servers. The different types of application servers are LAN application servers: query-based application servers, and application/web servers. A file server is either dedicated or non-dedicated. Network services servers provide core services on the OSI application layer. Although the NOS provides many network services and protocols, services such as the DNS, DHCP, IM, VoIP, and NTP may come from a network services server. Proxy servers are intermediate network servers that accept, fulfill, filter, and forward requests from remote clients. The types of proxy servers are: gateway, internet-facing, open, internal-facing, and reverse. Two other server types that you may encounter on the Server+ exam are RRAS, which is a type of network services server that provides firewall, router, and remote access services, and a virtual server that is a software-enabled logic object operating in the memory of a physical computer. Servers and computers, in general, conform to a particular form factor standard. A form factor designates the dimensions, shape, physical characteristics, and power and cooling performance of a computer case along, with the power supply, motherboard, RAM, and other components installed inside the system case.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">The form factor standard for servers is ATX. Tower computers have a standing case or cabinet, as do desktop and notebook designs. Rack-mountable servers are commonly 1U or 2U in height with their width matching the width of the rack or cabinet. A blade server enclosure is a cabinet of sorts that houses server blades, each of which is a server itself. A PSU converts domestic AC or DC (110V or 230V) into +3.3VDC, +5VDC, and +/- 12VDC and telecommunication devices use -48V power. Factors for consideration when selecting a PSU for a server include wattage, connectors and modularity, efficiency rating, rails, external connection, and voltage switching. Redundant power supplies have two or more PSUs that can provide power in combination, alternatively, or with actives and standbys. The components inside a server, especially CPUs, GPUs, chipsets, RAM, and VRMs, produce heat that can cause thermal stress on some components. Thermal stress can, and usually does, affect electronic components.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Two types of cooling systems are common in servers: passive-cooling (air-cooling) and liquid-cooling systems. A passive system includes a heat sink, thermal paste, and a case fan. Liquid-cooling systems pump distilled water through piping and a radiator, where the heat absorbed by the water cools before being recycled. In the next chapter, we'll take a look at the key internal components of a server, the ones that use power and need cooling. This includes the CPU, RAM, the various bus structures, BIOS/UEFI and CMOS. These internal server components are extremely important to the overall operations of a server, which is why they are emphasized in the Server+ exam.</p>
