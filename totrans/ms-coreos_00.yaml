- en: Public cloud providers such as Amazon and Google have revolutionized cloud technologies
    and made it easier to consume for end users. The goal of CoreOS has been to create
    a secure and reliable cluster OS and make it easier to develop distributed applications
    using Containers. CoreOS's philosophy has been to keep the kernel to a bare minimum
    while keeping it secure, reliable, and updated. Everything on top of the kernel
    runs as Containers, except a few critical services. Containers have revolutionized
    application development as well as application deployment. Even though Containers
    existed for a long time, Docker revolutionized the Container technology by making
    it easier to consume and distribute Containers.

- en: By making critical components of their technologies open source, CoreOS has
    created a major following in the CoreOS community as well as the general Linux
    and cloud communities. With Tectonic, CoreOS has combined all its open source
    technologies along with Kubernetes into one commercial offering. Cluster OS, Containers,
    and distributed application deployment are all pretty new and there is a lot of
    development happening in these areas. CoreOS is at a sweet spot, and this will
    encourage you to understand more about it.

- en: This book starts off with an overview of CoreOS and distributed application
    development and the related technologies around it. You will initially learn about
    installing CoreOS in different environments and using the CoreOS automatic update
    service. Next, critical CoreOS services to manage and interconnect services are
    covered along with networking and storage considerations. After this, the Container
    ecosystem, including Docker and Rkt, are covered along with Container orchestration.
    This book also covers how popular orchestration solutions such as OpenStack, the
    AWS Container service, and the Google Container engine integrate with CoreOS and
    Docker. Lastly, the book covers troubleshooting and production considerations
    for Containers, CoreOS, and distributed application development and deployment.
