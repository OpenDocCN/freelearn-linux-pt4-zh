    that it will never be necessary. The complexity of a disaster recovery program
    rises and falls with the size, locale, diversity, and application of the systems
    involved. Smaller system environments can protect themselves against a disaster
    merely by regularly taking a backup of their systems. Larger data center environments
    that support distributed systems, large networks, virtualization, and perhaps
    a cloud service, have a much more complicated task in identifying the required
    elements of continuity and their sequence for recovery—not to mention, exactly
    how soon and where the recovery is to happen. A medium-sized operation falls somewhere
    in between these two extremes.

    should have a formal, written plan to continue its operations during or after
    a catastrophic event. Having such a plan can help an organization remain viable
    and stay in business. A BCP outlines the objectives, procedures, and step-by-step
    actions required to restart or continue an organization's as-normal-as-possible
    operations after a disruptive event. A BCP is different from a **disaster recovery
    plan** (**DRP**). A DRP focuses on the restoration of the computing infrastructure
    and its associated services. On the other hand, a BCP, which encompasses the DRP,
    takes a broader look at the business and the restoration or continuity of the
    functions of the entire organization, including its operational processes, equipment,
    staffing, and inventory.

    separately from the system. A backup is created on a periodic basis. Replication
    is an online, real-time duplicate of a primary data store. Data replication is
    synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous simultaneously writes to two storage
    devices. Asynchronous is an approach that's used for replication over a distance.
    Latency is an issue regarding synchronous replication, but not with asynchronous
    replication. Some replication methods include disk-to-disk, server-based, server-to-self,
    cluster-to-cluster, and server-to-server, while some data backup methods include
    full, copy, incremental, differential, and snapshot. The general backup mediums
