- en: Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away
    from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed
    systems to easily be built and run effectively. It improves resource utilization,
    simplifies system administration, and supports a wide variety of distributed applications
    that can be effortlessly deployed leveraging its pluggable architecture.

    using all the standard DevOps tools to port Mesos frameworks effectively and in
    general demystify the concept of Mesos.

- en: The book will first establish the raison d'être of Mesos and explain its architecture
    in an effective manner. From there, the book will walk the reader through the
    complex world of Mesos, moving progressively from simple single machine setups
    to highly complex multi-node cluster setups with new concepts logically introduced
    along the way. At the end of the journey, the reader will be armed with all the
    resources that he/she requires to effectively manage the complexities of today's
    modern datacenter requirements.
