    referred to as a **node** or **member**) that work together so that the set is
    seen as a single system from the outside.

- en: The enterprise and science environments often require high computing power to
    analyze massive amounts of data produced every day, and redundancy. In order for
    the results to be always available to people either using those services or managing
    them, we rely on the high availability and performance of computer systems. The
    need of Internet websites, such as those used by banks and other commercial institutions,
    to perform well when under a significant load is a clear example of the advantages
    of using clusters.

- en: There are two typical cluster setups. The first one involves assigning a different
    task to each node, thus achieving a higher performance compared with several tasks
    being performed by a single member on its own. Another classic use of clustering
    is to help ensure high availability by providing failover capabilities to the
    set where one node may automatically replace a failed member to minimize the downtime
    of one or several critical services. In either case, the concept of clustering
    implies not only taking advantage of the computing functionality of each member
    alone, but also maximizing it by complementing it with the others.
  id: totrans-6

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This type of cluster setup is called **high availability** (**HA**), and it
    aims to eliminate system downtime by failing over services from one node to another
    in case one of them experiences an issue that renders it inoperative. As opposed
    to switchover, which requires human intervention, a failover procedure is performed
    automatically by the cluster without any downtime. In other words, this operation
    is transparent to end users and clients from outside the cluster.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second setup uses its nodes to perform operations in parallel in order to
    enhance the performance of one or more applications, and is called a **high-performance
    cluster** (**HPC**). HPCs are typically seen in scenarios involving applications
    and processes that use large collections of data.

    This choice is supported by the fact that this involves low costs and stability
    associated with this setup—no paid operating system or software licenses, along
    with the possibility of running Linux on systems with small resources (such as
    a Raspberry Pi or relatively old hardware). Thus, we can set up a cluster with
    very little resources or money.

    that will make up our system. Our choice of operating system is Linux and CentOS
    version 7, as the distribution, which is the latest available release of CentOS
    as of now. The binary compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux © (which is
    one of the most well-used distributions in enterprise and scientific environments)
    along with its well-proven stability are the reasons behind this decision.

    directory. The first one is the configuration file for the network card that we
    will use to access the Internet and to connect via SSH using an outside client,
    whereas the second will be used in a later chapter to be a part of a cluster resource.
    Note that the exact naming of the network interfaces may differ a little, but

    it. If there have been any errors, the output of `systemctl status sshd` will
    give you indications as to what is wrong with the service and why it is refusing
    to start properly. Following those directions, you will be able to troubleshoot
    the problem without much hassle.

- en: In this chapter, we reviewed how to install the operating system and installed
    the necessary software components to implement the basic cluster functionality.
    Ensure that you have installed your nodes, the basic clustering software as outlined
    earlier in this chapter, and configured the network and SSH access before proceeding
    with [Chapter 2](part0018_split_000.html#H5A42-1d2c6d19b9d242db82da724021b51ea0
    "Chapter 2. Installing Cluster Services and Configuring Network Components"),
    *Installing Cluster Services and Configuring Network Components*, where we will
    configure the resource manager, the messaging layer, and the firewall service
    in order to actually start building our cluster.
