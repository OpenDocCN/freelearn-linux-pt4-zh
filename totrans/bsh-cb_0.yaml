- en: In this book, we are writing a variety of scripts using **Bash**, or the **Bourne
    Again Shell**. They range from simple to more complex and handy utilities or programs.
    Currently, Bash is the default shell used by most GNU/Linux distributions and
    is used ubiquitously within the Linux Terminal. It can be used for any number
    of tasks and is flexible across the Linux/Unix ecosystem. In other words, a user
    familiar with Bash and the Linux CLI can install it themselves on almost any other
    Linux system and perform similar tasks with a negligible amount of alterations
    (if any are required at all). Bash scripts can also still work with few dependencies
    on other software installed, and on a very lean system (minimal installation),
    a user can still write a powerful script to automate tasks or assist with repeated
    task execution.

- en: This cookbook focuses entirely on Bash usage in an Ubuntu environment, a very
    common Linux distribution, but it should be portable to other distributions with
    relative ease. This book is not written for direct usage on Apple or Windows OSes
    even though it is possible to port elements over to them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Bash Cookbook* is for power users or system administrators who are involved
    in writing Bash scripts in order to automate tasks or are aiming to enhance their
    productivity on the command line. For example, instead of remembering a series
    of commands to perform a specific operation, all of those commands can be put
    into a single script dedicated to that task, and they can perform input validation
    and format output. Why not save time and reduce errors through a powerful tool?'

- en: This book is also ideal if you are interested in learning how to automate complex
    daily system tasks that can be executed by various system infrastructure such
    as starting a script on system boot, or through scheduled cron jobs.
