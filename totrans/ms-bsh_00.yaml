    on. Whatever you want to do, you have to log in to a shell, and most of the time,
    it will be Bash. This book aims to explain how to use this tool to get the most
    out of it, whether it be programming a plugin or network client or simply explaining
    why a double dot means what it means, we will dig a bit deeper than usual to become
    fully confident with our shell. Starting from the basics but with a different
    point of view, we will climb up step by step, focusing on the programming side
    of our environment, looking at how to prevent any issues in setting up our recurring
    tasks and ensure that everything works fine. Make it once, take your time, debug,
    improve, and then fire and forget; as in old Linux saying states, "If it works,
    why change it?" So, since we are dealing with sayings, we could stick to the other
    two cornerstones: "KISS: Keep it simple, stupid" and "Do only one thing, but do
    it well." These are three principles around which Linux revolves: making something,
    not everything, and making it simple and reliable and taking your time to make
    it work well so you do not have to modify it too often over time. When something
    is focused and simple, it is easy to understand, well maintained, and safe. And
    that is our approach, since Bash is not only a tool but also the environment we
    spend a lot of time in, and so understanding it, making the best use of it, and
    keeping everything clean and tidy should be our daily aim.'

    is greater, equal to, or less than something else and how to add, subtract, and
    fiddle with numbers. This is the first step toward imposing conditions on events
    dealt with in our scripts.'

    be used without knowing exactly what they do. Furthermore, the variables hold
    values that must be preserved while we are working on them. This is where we''ll
    learn to be cautions about what we are going to write.'

    for example, giving the user the chance to answer some questions and deal with
    the options highlighted. This involves the ability to create a command-line interface
    for the program itself and a way to store the data in a structure that will make
    it easy to retrieve that data. And that is what arrays are all about*.*'

    processing them based on some conditions while they last, for instance, or for
    some values we use as counters. We will learn how to use while and for loops.'

    Nagios, which is all about plugins. You can write complex programs in any language
    to perform whichever checks you want on your sites and applications. But some
    of the most tricky plugins I have used have been written using Bash, and nothing

    Why not write a small fragment of code to send our thoughts over a Slack channel
    and, maybe, make a communication plugin out of it, enabling other scripts to send messages
    through the messaging system?'

    Our script has to do many things at once, using a sort of raw parallelism to get
    to the desired outcome. Well, it''s time to see what we can spawn inside a shell,
    how to control our jobs, and send signals.'

    enough. It will not survive long, but you can use some tricks such as double forking,
    setsid, and disowning to make it a bit devilish and survive until process death.

    a method to run our scripts based on some conditions. The most common is based
    on time, such as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly repetitions. Just think about
    a simple log rotation triggered on certain conditions, the most common being on
