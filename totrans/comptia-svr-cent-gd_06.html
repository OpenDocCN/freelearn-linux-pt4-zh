<p>You'd have a difficult time locating a particular address in a large city using only a general description of the house in question. In the same way, a computer's <strong>operating system</strong> (<strong>OS</strong>) would have problems finding a data file for you if all you know is what's in it.</p>
<p>Back in the day, when secondary storage was small, it was relatively easy to find files on a floppy disk or hard disk. Connecting to another PC over a peer-to-peer network was straightforward and didn't require much in the way of an address<span>—</span>just the internal address of a parallel port.</p>
<p>However, on today's network and storage technologies, with their immensity, addressing on all levels is an essential part of computing.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we look at the variety of addressing schemes used in computing and networking<span>—</span>their structures, representations, and purposes. We also look at the interface between a computer and a network, and the protocols and services that provide their connection, transmission, and security.</p>
<p>We take a outside-in approach to addressing, beginning with <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>) addressing and ending with <strong>Media Access Control</strong> (<strong>MAC</strong>) and port addressing.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP addressing</li>
<li>IP version 4</li>
<li>IP version 6</li>
<li>MAC addressing</li>
<li>Address resolution</li>
<li>Ports and protocols</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of the Server+ exam, we really don't need to cover the entire history of network addressing, from the development of packet switching 50 or so years ago to IP version 6 addressing today.</p>
<p>When TCP replaced the earlier <strong>Network Control Protocol</strong> (<strong>NCP</strong>) in 1974, it performed both data transmission and message routing. These two functions were later split into what we know today as TCP and IP, as in the TCP/IP protocol suite.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of an IP is to provide a path through a network of computing and routing devices interconnected by communication links in an unstructured manner.</p>
<p>Early on, it became clear that one of the underlying design features of the internet was that it provided no single point of failure. This led to its purposefully haphazard construction, and the need for a flexible addressing scheme.</p>
<p>The TCP/IP protocols developed over the years into the standard that is still largely in use today. Given that there was pressure on the developers from large communication corporations, government agencies, and small and medium-sized businesses, an address class system divided up the available address range to provide ample network addresses to all parties<span>—</span>at least at first.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>What we have come to know as an IP address in general, the IPv4 address, consists of 32 bits divided into four eight-bit octets (groups of eight). For the sake of humans, a format called <strong>dot-decimal</strong> formats the binary address into four decimal numbers separated by dots, or periods.</p>
<p>For example, the following shows the binary number version of an IP address and its decimal number equivalent:</p>
<pre>Binary value: 10101001.1110011.00011001.11011010<br/>Decimal value: 169. 115.25.218</pre>
<p>Each set of four octets represents a single addressable network location.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>An octet may hold binary values in the range from 00000000 to 11111111, or 0 to 255 in decimal, respectively. Therefore, the total range of IPv4 addresses starts at the following:</p>
<pre>00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000 (decimal 0.0.0.0)</pre>
<p>The range goes up to the following:</p>
<pre>11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111 (decimal 255.255.255.255)</pre>
<p>A significant number of the addresses in this range are set aside for special purposes. This means that not all of the addresses in the range are available for assignment to network nodes. We will talk more about this later in this section.</p>

<p>The address classes shown in the table simplified the assignment of addresses to the various communication, manufacturing, services, government agencies, and companies wanting to be <strong>internet service providers</strong> (<strong>ISPs</strong>). If an organization could demonstrate a certain level of need, based on the size of its network or business model, it received a block of addresses from an appropriate address class.</p>

<p>However, like all good things, IPv4 addresses (all 4 billion of them) soon began running out. IPv6 was in development, but neither the technology nor the network managers were ready for the upgrade.</p>
<p>So, to avoid a complete exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, a variety of techniques emerged to maximize the usage of an IP address, and to minimize the need for additional addresses. These developments included private IP addresses, subnetting, CIDR, NAT, PAT, and others.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line, it occurred to someone that, of the network-attached devices behind an organization's gateway router (edge router), those on a <strong>local area network</strong> (<strong>LAN</strong>) really don't need assigned public IP addresses. The majority of LAN traffic is between its nodes, and that occurs on the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and makes use of the <strong>Media Access Control</strong> (<strong>MAC</strong>) sublayer address (physical address).</p>
<p>But <em>what if an organization with several LANs doesn't have a sufficient number of public IP addresses to configure every network node with its own?</em> Finding enough IPv4 addresses is the least of its problems.</p>
<p>Although it reduced the number of IPv4 addresses in the assignable pool, three blocks of addresses, one from each of the classes A, B, and C, were set aside for use as private addresses. The <strong>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</strong> (<strong>IANA</strong>) designated private IP addresses for use on any network behind a gateway router or <strong>network address translation</strong> (<strong>NAT</strong>) device (more on which later in this section). Private IP addresses are, by definition, non-routable.</p>
<p>As shown in the following table, each of the assignable address classes (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>) have a range of private IP addresses:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Address masks and class IDs extract the network ID from an IPv4 address</div>
<p>The high-order (leftmost) bit or bits in the first (leftmost) octet indicate the address class of an IPv4 address. <em>Why?</em> The short answer is that extracting the network ID from the IPv4 address requires the use of the appropriate address mask.</p>
<p>The process of extracting the network ID from an IPv4 address applies a bit-wise AND operation to the address and the mask corresponding to the address class of the address. The following table shows the steps taken:</p>

The steps to extract the network ID from a Class A IPv4 address</div>
<p><span>First, the <kbd>IPv4 dot.decimal</kbd> address converts to binary. Then the binary form of the default Class A (</span><kbd>0</kbd> <span>in the first bit) address mask is ANDed to the binary IPv4 address.</span></p>
<p>The bit-wise ANDing process compares two bits, and if both have the value of <kbd>1</kbd>, the result is set to a <kbd>1</kbd>. All other combinations of the two bits result in zero. For example, in the preceding table, the IPv4 address has the binary value of <kbd>00001010</kbd>, and the default Class A mask has the binary value of <kbd>11111111</kbd>. The AND operation compares the two values; only when the two bits (upper and lower, address and mask) both have a <kbd>1</kbd> is the result set to a <kbd>1</kbd>.</p>
<p>The operation looks something like the following:</p>

<p>Because private IPv4 addresses aren't routable, LAN nodes with private addresses can't request content from the internet. Any content request made to a server on the internet must contain the IP address of the requester.</p>
<p>If the source address is a private address, there is no way for the server or any intermediate devices between the server and the requester to know which <kbd>192.168.0.0</kbd> private network the requesting node is in.</p>
<p>To remedy this problem, the NAT protocol, configured on the gateway router, applies a public IP address as an alias for the requester's private address. NAT records the pairing of the assigned public address and the private address to which it's matched in a table. When the response arrives, NAT uses its source address (the sender) to look up the private address of the requester/destination, and forwards the information.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the elements of this process:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1021 image-border" src="Images/e30efead-6ce4-474a-ab69-888a69b6db1d.jpg" style="width:36.08em;height:20.17em;" width="800" height="448"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The functional elements of the NAT protocol</div>
<p>Although the diagram shows the NAT operation with multiple alias addresses, many NAT implementations use only a single public address (typically, the address of the router), and tracks requests in the same manner as shown.</p>
<p>The primary mechanism that enables the use of a single public address is <strong>Port Address Translation</strong> (<strong>PAT</strong>), otherwise known as NAT overloading. To differentiate between outbound requests, PAT applies a unique port number to the private address of the requesting LAN node.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Two common problems inherent to Ethernet LANs are collisions and broadcast messages. Collisions occur when two (or more) nodes attempt to transmit on the network medium simultaneously, effectively destroying both messages.</p>
<p>Broadcast messages are a normal part of an Ethernet network's operations, but reducing the size of the network also reduces the impact these messages have on network performance.</p>
<p>Ethernet networks use a procedure called <strong>Collision Sense Multiple Access</strong>/<strong>Collision Detection</strong> (<strong>CSMA</strong>/<strong>CD</strong>) to detect when a collision has occurred on the network medium. CSMA/CD uses a back-off timer to stagger the retransmissions from the colliding nodes. On a wireless network, the procedure <strong>CSMA</strong>/<strong>Collision Avoidance</strong> (<strong>CSMA</strong>/<strong>CA</strong>) attempts to avoid collisions before they happen.</p>
<p>To regardless of whether the network medium is a cable or radio frequency waves, network nodes must share the common medium, often at the same time.</p>
<p>A grouping of network nodes connected through a hub or repeater is a collision domain. As shown in the following diagram, network segments behind a network hub are collision domains and, in this case, three collision domains exist behind a network switch:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1022 image-border" src="Images/f8b57eee-0eaa-4292-937c-4c92dcca03a3.jpg" style="width:35.67em;height:25.75em;" width="955" height="689"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Collision and broadcast domains on a LAN</div>
<p><span>In fact, all the nodes behind the switch are in one large collision domain. This would be especially true if these workstations were on a wireless network.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>On the other hand, a broadcast domain includes all the network nodes that are able to communicate with each other. In virtually all networks, a broadcast domain encompasses all of the collision domains, as illustrated in the preceding diagram.</p>
<p>On a computer network, broadcasting means essentially the same as it does in radio or television. A network node transmits a message, typically a request, to the entire network, meaning every active connected device.</p>
<p>In most cases, a broadcast message on a LAN results in each receiving node sending out its own broadcast messages. This is the reason why network administrators try to limit the overall size of broadcast domains.</p>
<p>The two most common uses of broadcast messages are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Startup</strong>: When you boot or restart a computer, its operating system sends a broadcast message on the network requesting its IP address configuration. It sends the broadcast message because, at that point, it doesn't have the address of the <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong> (<strong>DHCP</strong>) server. If all is well, the DHCP server responds only to the requesting node with its configuration data. Any computers on a network that have a very specialized function or setup may not or should not use a DHCP configuration. In these cases, the node should be configured with static configuration settings.</li>
<li><strong>Address resolution</strong>: The <strong>Address Resolution Protocol</strong> (<strong>ARP</strong>) and its mirror-image, the <strong>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol</strong> (<strong>RARP</strong>), use broadcast messages to ask network nodes which of them has a certain MAC address (more on this later), and to send back its IP address. The request could also be in reverse, with RARP asking for the MAC address that corresponds to a certain IP address.</li>
</ul>
<p>Broadcast messages carry a unique IP address, one reserved specifically for this purpose: <kbd>255.255.255.255</kbd>. When network devices see a message with this destination address, they know that it's a broadcast message.</p>

<p>Another way to express an IPv4 address that eliminates most of the need for an address mask is the CIDR address notation.</p>
<p>CIDR (pronounced variably as <em>cedar</em>, <em>cider</em>, or <em>kidder</em>, and also known as <strong>supernetting</strong>) denotes the number of bits in an IPv4 address that designate the network ID, without any consideration as to which address class it is.</p>
<p>For example, a standard Class A address has the following pattern:</p>
<pre>nnnnnnnn.hhhhhhhh.hhhhhhhh.hhhhhhhh</pre>
<p>Here, <em>n</em> denotes the network ID, and <em>h</em> denotes the host ID.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the address <kbd>101.15.105.10</kbd>, the network ID is <kbd>101.0.0.0</kbd>. Its address mask is <kbd>255.0.0.0</kbd>. This same address expressed in CIDR notation is <kbd>101.15.105.10/8</kbd>, which indicates that the leftmost eight bits are the network ID.</p>
<p>CIDR provides greater flexibility for extending networks without requiring additional IPv4 addresses.</p>

<p>A <strong>subnetwork</strong> (<strong>subnet</strong>) is a logical segment of a larger network that provides a variety of benefits to the network, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limiting broadcast messages</strong>: Subnetting a network creates smaller broadcast and collision domains</li>
<li><strong>Expanding a network's size</strong>: Subnetting facilitates the expansion of a network without purchasing additional IP addresses</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Subnetting allows for the isolation of protected departments or functions, such as accounting or research</li>
</ul>
<p>Subnetting is a logical addressing technique that creates smaller subnetworks using existing (in place) IPv4 addresses. The basic principle behind subnetting is the reassignment of one or more bits in the address mask, which in this case becomes a <strong>subnet mask</strong>, to provide for additional networks (subnetworks), as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<p><span>If we wish to set up a subnet for each department, we need to be able to address five subnets. In a general approach to subnets, each will have the same number of hosts, which in this case must be at least 18 hosts.</span></p>
<p>Remember, when determining how many bits to take from the host ID and apply to the subnet ID, that 2 raised to the power of the number of borrowed bits is the number of subnets that it creates. For example, ServersRUs needs five subnets, and 5 isn't a power of 2. At the low end of the powers of 2, we have the values of 1 (2<sup>0</sup>), 2 (2<sup>1</sup>), 4 (2<sup>2</sup>), and 8 (2<sup>3</sup>).</p>
<p>Of these, only 2<sup>3,</sup> or 8, provides for the five subnets needed, with the remaining three subnets available if or when needed. </p>
<p>We have determined that three bits are to move from the host ID and to be used for the subnet ID. This leaves five bits for the host ID within each subnet. <em>Are five bits enough to provide each subnet with the number of hosts required?</em> The customer support department requires 18 hosts, which must be our target number. So, if we raise 2 to the power of 5 (number of bits), we are able to address 32 hosts on each subnet.</p>
<p>There is a formula in subnetting that works for calculating the number of subnets available and the number of hosts available on a subnet: <em>2n-2</em> = addressable subnets or hosts. In this formula, <em>n</em> represents the number of bits borrowed (subnets) or remaining (hosts). We'll discuss the <em>-2</em> in a minute.</p>

<p>As shown in the preceding table, borrowing bits changes the values of the address mask/subnet mask. If we take zero bits, we have a standard Class C network with one network and 254 hosts. However, if we reassign four bits, we are able to address 16 subnets with 14 usable hosts per subnet.</p>
<p>Because we added four bits to the 24 bits already in a Class C address mask, we now have 28 (/28) bits in the network ID of our network. The following table shows how this impacts the value of the subnet mask:</p>

<p>IPv6, first introduced in 1998, has slowly replaced or supplemented IPv4 addressing, particularly gaining momentum over the past few years. The reason for the development of IPv6 was to forestall the rapid depletion of IPv4 addresses.</p>
<p>The IPv6 structure extended the number of available network and host addresses to what should be a sufficient number for the foreseeable future. The IPv6 address space provides for 2,128 addresses, which is around 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 (340+ undecillion) individual addresses.</p>
<p>At the present time, only about 20 percent of these addresses are available. Don't worry, though, we won't be running out any time soon, because the current pool has enough addresses for everyone on the planet to be issued more than 3,000 addresses each.</p>

<p>IPv6 allows for the compression of sections with only zeros, replacing two or more contiguous hextets with a double colon (<kbd>::</kbd>). For example, the preceding address becomes <kbd>FE80::0202:FFFA:C4DD:7435</kbd> in compressed form.</p>
<p>However, an IPv6 address may contain only one double colon. This means that, if an address has two or more hextet groups of all zeros, compression can only apply to one of them. For example, the address <kbd>FE80:0000:0000:0000:0202:0000:0000:7435</kbd> compresses to <kbd>FE80::0202:0000:0000:7435</kbd>.</p>

<p>A hextet with one or more zeros in its most significant positions (leftmost) is compressible, removing the zeros.

<p>Because IPv6 doesn't define address classes, a fixed segment of the address represents the network identifier. By standard, the first 64 bits of an IPv6 address identify the network address of the source or destination of a message, but this can vary.</p>
<p>A network of a single host has a network ID of 128 bits. IPv6 uses the CIDR notation to indicate the network ID in an address. An address with a /64 has the first 64 bits as its network address.</p>
<p>IPv6 also reserves certain bit-lengths for special purposes. The following table lists just a few of these:</p>

<p>IPv6 addresses generally fall into one of three address categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unicast</strong>: An IPv6 unicast address identifies a single destination, and packets with that unicast address go to that address.</li>
<li><strong>Multicast</strong>: An IPv6 multicast address identifies a group of nodes perhaps scattered across several networks. Each of the nodes included in the multicast address receives the transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Anycast</strong>: An IPv6 packet with an anycast address goes to only one of an identified set of nodes. The receiving node is typically the closest, in terms of distance and availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the three categories:</p>

            <article>
                
<p>IP addresses will work for the addressing within a LAN, but they are really not necessary for internal communications. Ethernet networks, for example, use an addressing scheme that operates on Layer 2 of the OSI model<span>—</span>the MAC address, otherwise known as the <strong>Data Link Control</strong> (<strong>DLC</strong>) address or physical address. While this number is more of an identification number, its universal uniqueness makes it ideal for addressing across a local network.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Every manufacturer of network or communication devices, such as NICs, switches, modems, routers, and so on, permanently embeds a unique identifying number into each device they produce. The manufacturer embeds this number into a ROM or firmware, so that it's permanently a part of the device.</p>
<p>A MAC/DLC address consists of 48 bits whose value in hexadecimal identifies both the manufacturer and the device. The first 24 bits of the MAC/DLC number identify the manufacturer with an <strong>Organizationally Unique Identifier</strong> (<strong>OUI</strong>) code, assigned to the producer by the <strong>Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers</strong> (<strong>IEEE</strong>).</p>
<p>The remaining 24 bits contain what is in effect a serial number unique to the OUI. The combination of the OUI and the serial number creates an identifying number that is unique.</p>
<p>Here's an example—a network adapter in a notebook computer has the MAC/DLC address <kbd>5C-E0-C5-B6-B3-9A</kbd>. The first three sections of this number (<kbd>5C-E0-C5</kbd>) indicate that its manufacturer is the Intel Corporation (Malaysia). The conversion of the serial number from hexadecimal to decimal gives the value 11973530, whatever that may mean. Regardless, this unique combination provides an unduplicated value that Layer 2 technologies use as an address.</p>

<p>When you have one type of address, but need another type, you use an address resolution protocol or service. An example might be when you have a person's name and address, but you need his or her telephone number. In this case, the address resolution method is to look up the name and address in a telephone directory to find the number you need.</p>
<p>On a computer network, there are device or configuration addresses that are appropriate for some purposes, but not for others. On an Ethernet network, the MAC/DLC address of a network adapter is sufficient for communications within the network. However, a message intended for a destination beyond the local network requires another level of address.</p>
<p>Using an address from one OSI layer to learn the corresponding address on another OSI layer is called address resolution. Commonly, this means resolving a MAC address to an IP address (or vice versa), or resolving a web domain name to an IP address.</p>
<p>The primary protocol and network service performing address resolution are, on local networks, the <strong>Address Resolution Protocol</strong> (<strong>ARP</strong>), and, on public networks, the <strong>Domain Name System</strong> (<strong>DNS</strong>).</p>

<p>The internet would be a lot more complicated to use if all sites had only IP addresses. It would be difficult to remember all of the numerical IP addresses, especially IPv6 addresses. To resolve this potential problem, we use domain names and top-level domain designators in combination, such as <kbd>packt.com</kbd>, where <kbd>packt</kbd> is the domain name and <kbd>.com</kbd> is the <strong>top-level domain</strong> (<strong>TLD</strong>) designation.</p>

<p>A domain name identifies a specific authority or autonomous realm on the web. Domain names are unique and issued to only a single entity, although some entities try to get close in spelling or sound to the domain names of others. Examples of familiar domain names are <kbd>google</kbd>, <kbd>amazon</kbd>, <kbd>euronews</kbd>, and <kbd>baidu</kbd>. The most popular TLDs include <kbd>.com</kbd>, <kbd>.net</kbd>, <kbd>.info</kbd>, <kbd>.gov</kbd>, and <kbd>.edu</kbd>.</p>
<p>Outside the United States, many domain names also include a country code as the TLD, such as <kbd>.uk</kbd>, <kbd>.ca</kbd>, <kbd>.cn</kbd>, or <kbd>.de</kbd>.</p>
<p>DNS search generally works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user enters the <strong>fully-qualified domain name</strong> (<strong>FQDN</strong>) of a website into the location bar of a browser, for example, <kbd>www.packt.com</kbd>, in which <kbd>www</kbd> is the hostname assigned to the web server for <kbd>packt.com</kbd>.</li>
<li>The browser detects that it must resolve the FQDN to an IP address, and sends a query to its designated DNS server.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>The DNS server searches in its <kbd>.com</kbd> entries for <kbd>packt</kbd>, and returns the corresponding IP address (<kbd>52.216.233.42</kbd>) to the browser.</li>
<li>The browser then issues an HTTP request to IP address <kbd>52.216.233.42</kbd> for the page requested.</li>

<p>A default domain suffix search list allows for a one or more unqualified single name or identifying words to initiate a DNS search. This list contains the domains that should be a part of a DNS search for an IP address.</p>
<p>For example, if <kbd>generic.mysite.info</kbd> is the FQDN for resolution, and the <kbd>mysite.info</kbd> search domain includes other hostnames such as normal, usual, or occasional, a domain search using a search domain suffix is easier for the user. By including <kbd>mysite.info</kbd> in a domain search list, the user only needs to enter the hostname. Likewise, just entering generic in the address bar causes the browser to append the search domain/domain suffix to the hostname before sending a request to a DNS server.</p>
<p>The domain suffix search list may contain several search domains, each of which generates a separate request to a DNS server.</p>

<p>Another type of network addressing uses transport layer ports to designate the endpoint to which a particular network packet is to be sent. The term <em>port</em> can refer to either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hardware connection point, such as an RJ-45 connection jack on a switch or router</li>
<li>A software-defined construct that, along with an IP address, establishes a <em>socket</em>, or the total address of the software that is to process the incoming packet</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the second definition that we are using here.</p>
<p>Data is transmitted on a network in <strong>protocol data units</strong> (<strong>PDUs</strong>). On different levels of the OSI model, PDUs are given different names<span>—for example, a</span> PDU on the Network Layer is known as a <strong>packet</strong>, and on the Data Link Layer it's called a <strong>frame</strong>.</p>
<p>On the Transport Layer, a PDU is known by two names—segments (TCP protocol) and datagrams (UDP protocol). The point of this is that ports are associated with TCP and UDP, and the segments and datagrams of each.</p>

<p>The port numbers available for assignment by the IANA range from 0 to 65535. Of these, ports <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>1023</kbd> are well-known ports. A <strong>well-known port</strong> is a service or protocol that resides on a private network or the public internet, and is a common server-based application.</p>
<p>As shown in the following table, each protocol/port combination has a numeric port associated with it:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>In this chapter, we discussed the fact that an IPv4 address is 32 bits divided into four octets in a dot-decimal format. An octet may hold values from 0 to 255. </p>
<p>We discussed how IPv4 addressing has address classes A, B, C, D, and E. Private addresses are for LANs. Each IPv4 address class has a standard subnet mask to identify its network ID: class A<span>—</span>eight bits; class B<span>—1</span>6 bits, and class C<span>—</span>24 bits. NAT devices mask private addresses with public addresses, whereas PAT applies a port number to a private address.</p>
<p>Next, we covered how collisions occur when nodes attempt to transmit simultaneously. The impact of broadcast messages reduces on smaller networks. CSMA/CD detects collisions, and staggers the retransmissions of colliding nodes. Wireless networks use CSMA/CA to avoid collisions. Common broadcasts are startup and address resolution. CIDR denotes the number of bits in the network ID of an IPv4 address.</p>
<p>We then looked at subnets, which are logical segments of a larger network. Subnetting alters the subnet mask to provide additional subnet IDs. The first address in the range of addresses of a subnet is its network address. The broadcast address of a subnet is the last address in its address range.</p>
<p>Next, we discussed IPv6. This increases the address length to 128 bits, divided into eight 16-bit blocks called hextets. The first 64 bits identify the network ID. IPv6 addresses can be unicast, multicast, or anycast. Ethernet networks use MAC/DLC addressing to identify the manufacturer and device. The first 24 bits is the OUI; the remaining 24 bits is a serial number.</p>
<p>We went on to look at the protocol and network services that perform address resolution, namely ARP, WINS, and DNS. ARP converts IP addresses into a corresponding MAC address, WINS converts NetBIOS names to MAC addresses, and DNS converts FQDNs to IP addresses. </p>
<p>Finally, we covered ports<span>—</span>software-defined identifiers that combine with an IP address to identify a socket, which designates the software to process the incoming packet. Port numbers range from <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>65535</kbd>. Ports <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>1023</kbd> are well-known ports.</p>
