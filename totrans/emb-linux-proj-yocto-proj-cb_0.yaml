    designed today. Over the last 10 years, this operating system has developed from
    dominating the server market to being the most used operating system in embedded
    systems, even those with real-time requirements. On the way, Linux has evolved,
    and the embedded industry has realized it has some key and unique characteristics:'

    Companies need to build an embedded system over the operating system, and that's
    where embedded Linux was finding it difficult to make its place—until Yocto arrived.

    embedded systems. It provides a standard build system that allows you to develop
    embedded products in a quick, reliable, and controlled way. Just as Linux has
    its strong points for embedded development, Yocto has its own too:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. The Build System"), *The Build System*, describes
    the use of the Poky build system and extends it with the Freescale BSP community
    layer. It also describes common build system configurations and features used
    to optimize the building of target images.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. The BSP Layer"), *The BSP Layer*, guides
    you through the customization of the BSP for your own product. It then explains
    how to configure, modify, build, and debug the U-Boot bootloader, the Linux kernel,
    and its device tree.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. The Software Layer"), *The Software Layer*,
    describes the process of creating a new software layer to hold new applications,
    services, or modifications to existing packages, as well as discussing a release
    process for license compliance.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Application Development"), *Application Development*,
    starts with toolchains and the Application Development Toolkit (ADT), and deals
    with application development in detail, including development environments such
    as Eclipse and Qt creator.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Debugging, Tracing, and Profiling"), *Debugging,
    Tracing, and Profiling*, discusses debugging tools and techniques, and explores
    the tracing functionalities offered by the Linux kernel, along with some of the
    user-space-tracing and profiling tools that make use of them.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes some basic working knowledge with GNU/Linux systems; applications
    such as the bash shell and derivatives; as well as standard tools such as grep,
    patch, diff, and so on. The examples have been tested with an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    system, but any Linux distribution supported by the Yocto Project can be used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not meant to be an introductory book to the Yocto project, and reading
    an introductory book, such as *Embedded Linux Development with Yocto Project*
    by Otavio Salvador and Daiane Angolini, also from Packt Publishing, is recommended.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is structured to follow the usual development workflow of an embedded
    Linux product, but chapters or even single recipes can be read independently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The recipes take a practical hands-on approach using a Freescale i.MX6-based
    system, the wandboard-quad, as base hardware. However, any other piece of i.MX-based
    hardware can be used to follow the examples.
