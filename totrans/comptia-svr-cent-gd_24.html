<p>Taking the CompTIA Server+ certification examination and achieving a score of 750 points or more to pass validates you as an information technology specialist with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform as a network server administrator. This also validates your knowledge of server fundamentals, virtualization, data storage technologies, security, troubleshooting, and disaster recovery.</p>
<p>The Server+ examination is vendor-neutral and includes questions and challenges that cover the major operating systems, network services, internetworking devices, and intra-network communications. As a certified Server+ professional, you aren't limited to working with only a single manufacturer or provider.</p>

<p>The current version of the Server+ certification exam is SK0-004. It was released in July, 2015, and is scheduled to be updated in 2020. The exam has 100 questions that are prorated per the coverage percentage of each of the major topical areas. All of the questions are multiple choice. Once you begin the test, you have 90 minutes to complete it and at the end of this time period, the exam closes.</p>
<p>The examination is given online and one question at a time. You are able to mark questions you'd like to go back to for review. Before the time runs out, you can complete the exam by submitting it as completed. You are appraised of your score almost immediately after completing the exam.</p>
<p>The exam's 100 questions are distributed according to the weighting given to each of the exam domains. For the current exam version, the number of questions you should expect in each domain are as follows:</p>

<p>Before the actual exam starts, you must review the CompTIA Candidate Agreement and indicate that you understand it and agree to abide by it. You are given 28 minutes to review the agreement.</p>
<p>During the exam, you aren't allowed to use any notes or references. In fact, even though the exam is online, you don't have access to the Web to look something up. You are provided with some sheets of note paper to use during the exam, but you must turn it in when you complete the exam.</p>
<p>The Server+ exam is available in four languages—English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese. When you register for the exam, you can indicate which language you prefer.</p>
<p>So, it boils down to just you and the exam, one-on-one.</p>

<p>CompTIA recommends that to be prepared for taking the Server+ certification exam, you should have 18 to 24 months of information technology experience, preferably working with servers and networks. CompTIA also recommends that you hold the A+ certification prior to taking the Server+ exam. It's not a bad idea to also have the Network+ certification, as well. However, none of these recommendations are requirements. If you believe you have the knowledge to pass the exam, give it a go. But, remember that it's $319.00 a pop.</p>
<p>In the CompTIA Candidate Agreement you agree to at the beginning of the testing period, it stipulates that you cannot use <em>brain dumps</em> and other unauthorized, and so-called <strong>actual exam content</strong> sources. You should read the Candidate Agreement prior to beginning your serious preparations and studies for the exam. It could save your certification.</p>
