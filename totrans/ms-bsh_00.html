<p class="calibre1"><span>Bash is a common tool for everyday tasks that almost every Linux user relies on. Whatever you want to do, you have to log in to a shell, and most of the time, it will be Bash. This book aims to explain how to use this tool to get the most out of it, whether it be programming a plugin or network client or simply explaining why a double dot means what it means, we will dig a bit deeper than usual to become fully confident with our shell. Starting from the basics but with a different point of view, we will climb up step by step, focusing on the programming side of our environment, looking at how to prevent any issues in setting up our recurring tasks and ensure that everything works fine. Make it once, take your time, debug, improve, and then fire and forget; as in old Linux saying states, "If it works, why change it?" So, since we are dealing with sayings, we could stick to the other two cornerstones: "KISS: Keep it simple, stupid" and "Do only one thing, but do it well." These are three principles around which Linux revolves: making something, not everything, and making it simple and reliable and taking your time to make it work well so you do not have to modify it too often over time. When something is focused and simple, it is easy to understand, well maintained, and safe. And that is our approach, since Bash is not only a tool but also the environment we spend a lot of time in, and so understanding it, making the best use of it, and keeping everything clean and tidy should be our daily aim.</span></p>

<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0021.html#K0RQ0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 1</a><em class="calibre20">, </em><em class="calibre20">Let's Start Programming</em>, is our first brush with the magic of Bash. We will use basic shell programming bits to write easy code that will forecast all the benefits of more advanced scripts.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0036.html#12AK80-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 2</a>,<em class="calibre20"> Operators</em>, is where we perform some simple operations, such as checking whether something is greater, equal to, or less than something else and how to add, subtract, and fiddle with numbers. This is the first step toward imposing conditions on events dealt with in our scripts.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0067.html#1VSLM0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre20">Testing</em>,<em class="calibre20"> </em>explains how checking whether something fits into boundaries and certain conditions are met or not is fundamental to making our scripts able to react to events and to decide what to do based on real-time indicators coming from the system or from other programs.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0075.html#27GQ60-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre20">Quoting and Escaping</em>, tells you how the shell has its own reserved words, which cannot be used without knowing exactly what they do. Furthermore, the variables hold values that must be preserved while we are working on them. This is where we'll learn to be cautions about what we are going to write.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0137.html#42KT20-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre20">Menus, Arrays, and Functions</em>, explores how to make the script interact with the user, for example, giving the user the chance to answer some questions and deal with the options highlighted. This involves the ability to create a command-line interface for the program itself and a way to store the data in a structure that will make it easy to retrieve that data. And that is what arrays are all about<em class="calibre20">.</em></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0142.html#47DFS0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre20">Iterations</em>, explains how iterations are fundamental to going over data and extracting and processing them based on some conditions while they last, for instance, or for some values we use as counters. We will learn how to use while and for loops.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0149.html#4E33Q0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 7</a>, <em class="calibre20">Plug into the Real World</em>, introduces one of the most famous open source monitoring system, Nagios, which is all about plugins. You can write complex programs in any language to perform whichever checks you want on your sites and applications. But some of the most tricky plugins I have used have been written using Bash, and nothing else.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0158.html#4MLOS0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 8</a>, <em class="calibre20">We Want to Chat</em>, is about Slack, currently one of the most widely used messaging systems. Why not write a small fragment of code to send our thoughts over a Slack channel and, maybe, make a communication plugin out of it, enabling other scripts to send messages through the messaging system?</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0167.html#4V8DU0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 9</a>, <em class="calibre20">Subshells, Signals, and Job Controls</em>, discusses how sometimes a single process is not enough. Our script has to do many things at once, using a sort of raw parallelism to get to the desired outcome. Well, it's time to see what we can spawn inside a shell, how to control our jobs, and send signals.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0174.html#55U1S0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 10</a>, <em class="calibre20">Let's Make a Process Chat</em>, explores the topic of processes talking to each other, feeding each other data and sharing the burden of data elaboration. Pipes, redirections, process substitution, and a bit of netcat--this could open up new scenarios, and we'll see how.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0184.html#5FF7G0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 11</a>, <em class="calibre20">Living as a Daemon</em>, explains how sometimes sending a script into the background is not enough. It will not survive long, but you can use some tricks such as double forking, setsid, and disowning to make it a bit devilish and survive until process death. Make it a daemon and let it wait for your orders.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0194.html#5P0D40-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 12</a>, <em class="calibre20">Remote Connections over SSH</em>, tells you how scripts can be run locally, but they can do much more for you. They can log in remotely over a secure channel and issue commands on your behalf without you inputting any further instructions. Everything is stored in a key, which unlocks a whole bunch of new possibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0205.html#63G3A0-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 13</a>, <em class="calibre20">It's Time for a Timer</em>, discusses how to fully automate routine tasks. We have to have a method to run our scripts based on some conditions. The most common is based on time, such as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly repetitions. Just think about a simple log rotation triggered on certain conditions, the most common being on a daily schedule.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a target="_blank" href="part0210.html#688M40-8ae483f626fa439a8b6ee1bf9fb955ec" class="calibre4">Chapter 14</a>, <em class="calibre20">Time for Safety</em>, explains how safety is a must in your working environment. Scripting often means access to remote servers and interacting with them, so learning some tricks to keep your server more secure will help you prevent intrusions and keep your job away from unwanted eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre1">This book assumes a good level of experience with Linux operating systems and an intermediate knowledge of the Bash shell, and since there will be some chapters dealing with Nagios monitoring and Slack messaging, basic understanding of networking concepts is required.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A simple Linux installation is required with really low specifications, as even the Nagios plugin can be tested without requiring the actual installation of the monitoring system. So, this is the minimum configuration required:</p>
<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13">CPU: single-core</li>
<li class="calibre13">Memory: 2 GB</li>
<li class="calibre13">Disk space: 20 GB</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre1">For this book, you will need the following software:</p>
<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre13">Linux operating system: Debian 8</li>
<li class="calibre13">Nagios Core 3.5.1</li>
<li class="calibre13">OpenSSH 6.7p1</li>
<li class="calibre13">rssh 2.3.4</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre1">Internet connectivity is required to install the necessary service packages and to try out some of the examples.</p>

<p class="calibre1">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "What is interesting here is that the value of <kbd class="calibre9">real</kbd> is slightly different between the two commands."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="codepackt">
<span>#!/bin/bash</span><span> <br class="title-page-name"/></span><span>set -x<br class="title-page-name"/></span><span>echo "The total disk allocation for this system is: "<br class="title-page-name"/></span><span>echo -e "\n"</span><span> <br class="title-page-name"/></span><span>df -h</span><span> <br class="title-page-name"/></span><span>echo -e "\n"</span><span> <br class="title-page-name"/></span><span>set +x</span><span> <br class="title-page-name"/></span><span>df -h | grep /dm-0 | awk '{print "Space left on root partition: " $4}'</span>
</pre>
<p class="calibre1">Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="codepackt">
