<p>A crucial part of any network are the data storage devices that allow data to be organized, cataloged, and mapped in permanent storage for the purposes of retention and retrieval. In our day-to-day computer use, we almost take the hard disk drive in our desktop or portable computer for granted. It's just there, after all. Data storage on a network, which uses basically the same storage technologies as the disk drive in the desktop computer, is more complicated and does require more attention.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll focus on the technology, devices, protocols, medium, and applications of data storage on a network. In doing so, we'll look at the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hardware specifications of data storage devices</li>
<li>The primary disk drive interface protocols</li>
<li>Data storage systems</li>
<li>File systems</li>
<li>Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)</li>
<li>Capacity planning for data storage needs</li>
</ul>

<p>Data has become one of the most valuable assets a person, business, company, enterprise, corporation, or organization has and must protect. Computing and storage devices that process and store data must be reliable and available, and above all else, secure.</p>
<p>In this section, we'll look at disk drive hardware and configuration, data storage and transfer protocols and technologies, and we'll also take a hard look at RAID.</p>

<p>On the most basic functioning levels, technology in hard disk drives, of all shapes and sizes is virtually the same. The following diagram shows the essential internal components of a basic hard disk drive. As this diagram illustrates, an actuator arm, attached to and positioned by the actuator shaft, extends, and retracts the read/write heads to place them over the appropriate track/cylinder and sector:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The primary components of a hard disk drive</div>
<p>As indicated earlier, hard disk drives come in a wide variety of sizes. In this case, size means different things: height, circumference, and capacity. A disk drive's form factor sets the first two characteristics. The capacity of a hard disk drive relates to the disk's form factor, but it's more a function of the technology in use.</p>

<p>A form factor, as we discussed in an earlier chapter, sets the form and fit of a computer's case, motherboard, power supply, and more. However, for a hard disk drive, the form factor sets the height, width, length, and the type and placement of its connector to the host computer. The following sections discuss the more popular hard disk form factors found in servers.</p>

<p>SFF is smaller than most other common forms. The diameter of the internal disk platters average 2.5 inches in diameter. The SFF standard specifies a drive width of 2.7 inches, an overall length of 100 mm, or 3.93 inches, and a height ranging from 5 mm (0.20 inches) to 15 mm (0.59 inches). Because of their compact size, SFF hard disk drives are common in notebooks and other portable computers. SFF drives can be used in desktop computers as well but require mounting brackets to fill up a 3.5-inch bay.</p>
<p>Because their storage capacity can be as much as 5 TB, SFF drives are in use in some server environments. In these systems, interactive and transaction-processing systems use SFF drives, and backup, archival, and larger volume backups use larger drives or technologies.</p>

<p>The height dimension of a <strong>large form factor</strong> (<strong>LFF</strong>) hard disk drive can range from 19.9 mm (0.78 inches) to 26.1 mm (1.03-inches). While this may not seem <em>large</em>, the latest LFF drives are able to store as much as 100 TB, depending on their technology (more on this later). The length dimension of an LFF drive is 146 mm (5.75 inches) and its width is 101.6 mm (4.0 inches). The following image illustrates the difference in the sizes of the SFF and the LFF:</p>

<p>The technical specifications of an HDD describe its technology, interface, capacity, and operational speeds. For any HDD, there are two sets of specifications: the device specifications and the configured specifications. <strong>Device specifications</strong> indicate the <em>raw</em> or unformatted measurements of the disk drive's components and operations. The <strong>configuration specifications</strong>, which are also called <strong>logical configurations,</strong> reflect any changes to the device specifications after formatting or partitioning the disk media.</p>
<p>The device specifications important to either internal or external disk drives are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revolutions per minute (RPM)</strong>: The two dominant RPM rates in HDDs are 7,200 and 5,400, which indicate the number of times the disk platters in a disk drive rotate in a minute. A higher number means a faster disk drive. For example, a 7,200 RPM drive is roughly one-third faster than a 5,400 RPM drive. In this case, faster means that the stored bits on the disk platter move under the read/write head at a faster rate, which speeds up the data transfer process.</li>
<li><strong>Interface</strong>: The type of communication interface a drive supports can indicate the capacity of a drive, the bus width used to transfer data to or from the HDD, and its maximum (raw) data storage capacity. The following table shows the transfer rates and maximum capacity for each of the currently popular hard disk bus interfaces (see the <em>Hard disk interfaces</em> section later in this chapter for more information):</li>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Characteristics of commonly used HDD interfaces</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access time</strong>: This is the aggregate of each of the timing elements that occur after the disk controller initiates an I/O action and immediately before data can be read from or written to the disk medium. Access time includes the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek time</strong>: The time it takes for the actuator arm to position the read/write head over the appropriate disk platter and then over the disk track on that platter that contains the targeted data sector.</li>
<li><strong>Rotational latency</strong>: Also known as rotational delay or latency, this is the time required for the rotating disk platter to move the targeted data sector under the read/write head.</li>
<li><strong>Command execution</strong> <strong>time</strong> and <strong>settle time</strong>: These measurements are generally very small and may not be included in a manufacturer's hard disk drive performance specifications. <strong>Command execution time</strong> is the time required to establish the link between the various elements involved in the transfer of data to or from the memory or the disk drive. <strong>Settle time</strong> is the time required to lower the read/write head into position to write data to the disk medium or read data from the disk medium. Most HDD specifications include settle time in seek time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Throughput</strong>: <span>Also known as</span> <strong>data transfer rate</strong> (<strong>DTR</strong>), this is the time required to move data from one location to another in a specific operation. In the context of an HDD, throughput is measured as <em>read throughput</em> and <em>write throughput</em>. In either case, this is what is required to move data from the read/write head to memory (read throughput) or from memory to the read/write head (write throughput).</li>
<li><strong>I/O operations per second (IOPS)</strong>: This is pronounced <em>eye-ops</em>, IOPS measures the number of read and write operations from and to random, non-contiguous addresses that an HDD can perform in one second. The structure of this measurement may vary from different manufacturers, so it may not be a reliable metric for comparing HDDs.</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>The storage capacity of a storage device, such as an HDD, is expressed as both a decimal value and a binary value, which can confuse the amount of actual space available on the device. For example, the decimal value of 1000<sup>10</sup> or 1 KB is often used interchangeably as the equivalent of 2<sup>10</sup> or 1024<sup>10 </sup>which is also referred to as 1 KB.</p>
<p>A hard disk drive and a few other storage devices often appear to lose around seven percent of their stated or nominal capacity after they are formatted. For example, a new 1 GB HDD ends up having only approximately 938 MB after being formatted. This difference represents the average of seven percent of the total storage that seems to disappear.</p>
<p>The confusion comes from the fact that a computer, because of its design, uses binary representations of numeric values, such as 2<sup>20</sup> being considered to be the same as 10<sup>6</sup>, or 1,048,576 being interchangeable with 1,000,000, or essentially 1 MB equaling 1 MB.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>A mechanical, or common, HDD has at least eight major moving parts, some of which are shown in <span><em>The primary components of a hard disk drive</em></span> image in <span>the <em>Hard drive specifications</em></span> section earlier in the chapter. Just the term <em>moving parts</em> may send up a red flag, because anything that moves can break or wear out. Okay, so not many hard drives fail due to a seized-up actuator arm or an intermittent read/write gap error, but they could. A hard disk drive that has no moving parts would be ideal and there'd be no threat of mechanical breakdown. An SSD is just such a device.</p>
<p>An SSD works along the lines of a USB flash memory drive in that both store data in semiconductor chips (see the following image). Solid-state is a term that has been around since the days of transistor radios. It refers to a circuit that is made up solely of semiconductors. Solid-state also means that there are no moving parts. SSDs are mostly designed for internal installation in a portable or compact computer, but they can also be external devices as well, sort of like very large flash drives. SSDs typically use either an SAS or SATA interface:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">An exploded view of an SSD.<br/>

<p>The benefits of using an SSD over an HDD are characterized mainly by three things: dependability, speed, and reduced power consumption. As shown in the following table, an SSD has an edge over an HDD, but only in the extreme. An SSD is nearly four times faster than an HDD on average and uses about half as much power. On the other hand, the capacity of an SSD hasn't caught up with HDD yet and its cost per GB is much higher. What this all means is that an SSD storage device is more dependable, faster, and operationally less costly to use. However, the upfront costs are higher:</p>

<p>Comparing an HDD to an SSD on just their speed ratings is simple—the SSD is faster. The answer to the question, <em>What is the difference between SSD and HDD?</em> is <em>pretty much everything</em>. Well, maybe not everything. After all, an SSD doesn't have all of the moving parts. In fact, it has none of those of an HDD. This removes some performance specifications from the comparison, such as RPM, rotational delay, settle time, and a few others.</p>
<p>Whereas an HDD is a serially accessed device, an SSD is a random-access device. You can randomly access an HDD, but there is latency in getting to the data. On an SSD, you go directly to the data. None of the latency issues associated with the physics of an HDD effect the performance of an SSD. Measures such as IOPS, access time, and throughput are many times higher or lower, as the case may be. Remember too that the SSD is more expensive, at least for the time being.</p>

<p>Although it may be inside the system case, an HDD is a peripheral device to the motherboard and CPU. An HDD and a computer communicate, that is, pass data to each other, through a drive interface. A drive interface is the bus structure that the device driver, the hard disk device, RAM, and controllers use to pass data requests and the data requested.</p>
<p>HDD interfaces are either word-serial or bit-serial. Word-oriented interfaces transfer data in 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit words using parallel bit signaling. Examples of word-oriented interfaces are the <strong>Small Computer Serial Interface</strong> (<strong>SCSI</strong>) and the <strong>Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment</strong> (<strong>PATA</strong>). Bit-oriented interfaces interconnect through a <strong>host bus adapter</strong> (<strong>HBA</strong>). Examples of bit-oriented interfaces are <strong>fibre channel</strong> (<strong>FC</strong>), <strong>serial ATA</strong> (<strong>SATA</strong>), and <strong>serial attached SCSI</strong> (<strong>SAS</strong>).</p>
<p>The HDD drive interfaces you should know about for the Security+ exam are as follows:</p>

<li><strong>PATA</strong>: PATA uses parallel bit signaling to transmit word-length data between an HDD and controllers and drivers. It connects to the system through an 80-pin cable that carries a 5V signal. Not every conductor carries data. If fact, every second wire is a ground. Because of the size of its connecting cable, a PATA HDD is an internally mounted device. PATA devices can transfer data with DTRs as high as 80 MBps.</li>
<li><strong>SATA</strong>: SATA uses serial bit signaling to transmit data between an HDD and the motherboard, controllers, and drivers. SATA transmits data over a 7-conductor cable at higher speeds. SATA came about primarily because the PATA standard was unable to support the higher <strong>data transfer rates</strong> (<strong>DTRs</strong>) of larger capacity disk drives. SATA devices can transfer data with DTRs as high as 600 MBps.</li>
<li><strong>SCSI</strong>: SCSI (<em>scuzzy</em>) provides a multiple-connection interface for a variety of devices, including HDD, optical drives, printers, scanners, and other peripherals. As many as 15 devices can be attached to an SCSI interface that occupies only a single HBA slot in a host computer. SCSI uses parallel bit signaling and can transfer data with DTRs as high as 80 MBps.</li>
<li><strong>SAS</strong>: SAS improves on its base interface SCSI by expanding several of its capabilities and capacities. SAS controllers are connected directly to SAS HDD. SAS can connect up to 128 different devices on a single interface. It is a full-duplex interface that can transfer data with DTRs as high as 3.0 GBps. Another important characteristic of SAS is that it is a hot-plug technology.</li>
<li><strong>FC</strong>: The FC technology is primarily a communication protocol commonly used in data centers and server farms. Although its name suggests that it is based on fibre optic cabling, because it's based on a protocol, the transmission medium it uses can be coaxial, copper twisted-pair, and fibre optic cabling. The type of cable used determines the length of separation for FC-connected devices. Copper-connected nodes should be within 100 feet, but multimodal fibre optic cable-connected devices can be as far as 10 kilometers (6.67 miles) apart. The FC technology is replacing SCSI in data centers because of its reliability, flexibility, speed, and distances. Currently, FC can transmit data with a 128 GBps DTR.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, we need to squeeze in some basic disk storage terminology and concepts. For the Server+ exam, your knowledge of these terms and concepts is generally assumed, so this is something we need to cover. In this and the next few sections, we'll look at the technical organization of data storage and retrieval methods, technologies, and systems.</p>

<p>The name DAS should be self-explanatory. DAS is any storage device, HDD, SSD, USB, tape, optical disc, flash drive, and so on connected directly to or attached to a computer. An HDD installed inside a computer's case is DAS; a USB-connected external HDD is DAS; and an a USB tape drive is DAS. In other words, if a data storage device is directly attached to a computer and its bus, it's DAS.</p>

<p>NAS, as shown in the next image, is one or more data storage devices attached to a network that network clients can share. NAS appears to network users much like DAS, especially when the <strong>Network File System</strong> (<strong>NFS</strong>) is in use. NFS is a network file-sharing protocol that allows authenticated and authorized users to access network file systems and resources, such as NAS. Although NFS is a common element of NAS systems, it can also work with unstructured clusters of HDDs, which are generally referred to as <strong>just a bunch of disks</strong> (<strong>JBOD</strong>). In a JBOD arrangement, the disks operate as independent devices:</p>

<p>One commonly used application for FC communication, especially in large networks and data centers, is a SAN. A SAN is a self-contained network of storage devices and specialized switches that provides high-speed data access to connected network nodes. To a network server, portions of a SAN appears to be directly connected to only that server. Every server connected to the SAN has this same view. A SAN provides network servers with the capability to move data between storage devices and perform backup and restore activities, in addition to providing multiple servers with data access.</p>

<p>As the following diagram illustrates, a SAN, in its simplest form, is made up of one or more network servers that are connected to a data storage array of two or more hard disk drives through one or more dedicated switches. In this diagram, the red, dashed box encloses what is called the <strong>fabric</strong>, which is the switch-controlled disk drive network of the SAN:</p>

<p>Most SANs use one of two communication technologies: FC and <strong>Internet SCSI</strong> (<strong>iSCSI</strong>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FC SAN:</strong> FC is the most commonly used SAN communication technology. An FC-based SAN incorporates FC switches that interconnect storage devices and FC HBAs that connect FC switches to network servers.</li>
<li><strong>iSCSI SAN:</strong> The iSCSI alternative doesn't require the specialized devices of the FC-based SAN. An iSCSI SAN can operate on Ethernet switches and physical connections to storage devices and network servers. The result is a lower-cost, although lower-performing, SAN solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another SAN option is <strong>Fibre Channel over Ethernet</strong> (<strong>FCoE</strong>). FCoE merges Ethernet and FC signals on a common network medium. However, not all Ethernet networking devices support the FCoE standard.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One critical element in a SAN, based on any of the communication technologies, is the LUN. A LUN is an identity assigned to a unit of SAN storage, which can be a portion of an HDD, an entire HDD, or even more than one HDD, especially in RAID configurations. A LUN represents a mapping between the storage media and network clients that indicates which network hosts can access which SAN-managed data.</p>
<p>On an FC SAN, setting up LUN zoning defines specifically which network servers/hosts have access to certain LUNs and their contents. As illustrated in the following <span>diagram</span>, the server on the left has zone access to the first and third LUNs and the server on the right can access the second and the fourth LUNs. LUN zoning is specific to FC SANs. iSCSI and FCoE, because they use Ethernet technology, are set up much like a <strong>virtual LAN</strong> (<strong>VLAN</strong>):</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">LUN zoning determines which hosts have access to which LUNs</div>
<p>Once LUN zoning is in place, LUN masking applies additional restrictions that can hide a LUN from specific servers and hosts. While LUN masking can be part of a security policy in many data centers, its primary usage is typically to restrict access to only the data a network server or host (and their users) requires.</p>

<p>Any computer, stand alone or network-attached, organizes the data it stores on secondary storage using a <strong>filesystem</strong>. A filesystem isn't just a pattern for storing data files. It also includes the processes, methods, and structures used to name, store, locate, and retrieve data. Although, it is also used by some to refer to a disk partition.</p>

<p>The <strong>Server Message Block</strong> (<strong>SMB</strong>) is a file-sharing protocol that give applications the capability to access files and other network resources on a network. A network client is able to create, open, read, write, or move data files on any network server configured to respond to SMB client requests. The SMB protocol has a standard format for SMB request messages, but different <em>dialects</em>, format variations, developed for a variety of specific operating systems or system requirements. One such dialect, actually one of the original dialects, is the <strong>Common Internet File System</strong> (<strong>CIFS</strong>), Microsoft's version of SMB for accessing file and print services on a network. Microsoft replaced CIFS with its own version of SMB.</p>
<p>Another commonly known dialect of SMB is <strong>Samba</strong>, which enables a Windows computer to share files with a computer running the UNIX or Linux operating system. Samba combines a number of different protocols and services, including SMB and <strong>NetBIOS over TCP/IP</strong> (<strong>NBT</strong>).</p>

<p>An essential element of data center and server administration is <strong>availability </strong>as, in a network, data stores, and communication links are always available, meaning 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In an electrically powered world, keeping electric devices always available goes beyond backup power units, <strong>uninterruptible power systems</strong> (<strong>UPSs</strong>), and generators. Even when electrical power is guaranteed to be always available, there are several other threats to the availability of a system or network. However, in your preparation for the Server+ exam, we should focus on the availability of data storage devices and systems, and particularly their reliability.</p>
<p>RAID is a technical methodology used to improve the availability, reliability, and performance of data storage systems, especially in larger data centers, cloud systems, and high-volume <strong>transaction processing systems</strong> (<strong>TPSs</strong>). In general, a RAID system is built on two or more HDD or SSD volumes that operate synchronously. There are no RAID standards and each company offering a RAID solution can offer its own specifications and levels. However, there are some practices and configurations that are generally implemented.</p>

<p>Striping and mirroring are the methods that a RAID system can use to create data redundancy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Striping</strong> separates data into chunks that are stored on two or more disk drives or volumes. The size of these chunks varies by provider and ranges from single bytes and fixed-length blocks to entire partitions. For example, a RAID system with 5 HDDs may stripe 128 KB data blocks onto each drive and, if needed, would continue by repeating the sequence. A RAID system with 10 disks could stripe a 10 MB file to each of the 10 disks in 1 MB stripes.</li>
<li><strong>Mirroring</strong> is essentially duplicating or copying data onto two or more drives. The primary purpose of mirroring is to provide an exact copy of a data file, for instance, so that it could be a failover should something happen to the original file or the drive on which it's stored. Although a mirror is like a backup, it's online and immediately available, where a backup requires a few more steps. Mirrored files are generally synchronized, meaning updates to the original are also made to the mirror. This may also speed up data access operations because parts of a data file can be read from both copies.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>RAID 0</strong>: RAID level 0 isn't a redundancy or data recovery method; it's more of a performance enhancer. By striping data to multiple disk drives, data I/O processes speed up. The next diagram illustrates striping across three disks:</li>
</ul>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">RAID 0 with data blocks striped across multiple disks</div>

<li><strong>RAID 1</strong>: RAID level 1 provides a mirror image or <em>replica</em> of a data block that is available for processing should a disk drive fail, or the primary data copy become corrupted. This diagram illustrates RAID 1 mirroring:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-977 image-border" src="Images/57edec11-4e30-4b51-a5ac-f26e1babd1e4.jpg" style="width:22.08em;height:13.58em;" width="671" height="412"/></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RAID 5</strong>: RAID level 5 looks like RAID 0 with parity added in (see the following diagram). The similarity goes only that far because RAID 5, which is the most common RAID implementation in enterprise networks and data centers, uses the striped data and parity information to recreate a data block from a failing drive on an active drive so processing may continue uninterrupted. The downside to a RAID 5 implementation is that in I/O heavy environments, especially those with a lot of write actions, latency could be an issue:</li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">RAID 5 with data and parity information striped to multiple drives</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAID 6</strong>: RAID level 6 is essentially RAID 5 with the parity information doubled, which means that two or more disk drives could fail and processing would continue. That is, providing that more than two drives are in the array. RAID 6 is also common to enterprise networks and data centers.</li>
<li><strong>RAID 10</strong>: RAID level 1+0 or 10 combines the mirroring of level 1 with the striping of level 0, but without parity. This RAID level is popular on smaller networks and servers and is applied through software RAID applications.</li>

<p>A RAID system can be implemented on a server, SAN, or NAS as hardware RAID or software RAID. Operationally, there isn't much difference between the two RAID types, although many experts favor hardware RAID. If there are differences, they are a part of where the RAID processing takes place. In a software RAID implementation, RAID processing is performed by a server's (typically the RAID host server's) CPU. Hardware RAID is implemented in a variety of ways: a RAID controller expansion card installed in a host server (as shown in the following image); a stand-alone RAID controller appliance; or disk drives with embedded RAID controllers. Performance is often given as the primary difference between the two, with hardware RAID having an advantage. However, the differences are dependent on the number of disk drives and their formatting and the RAID level in use:</p>

<p>An array controller, also known as a disk array controller, RAID controller, and <strong>storage processor</strong> (<strong>SP</strong>), manages and controls an array of disk drives, which it presents to servers and hosts as one or more logical units. The disk array can be one big JBOD or configured as  NAS or SAN. An array controller typically has three main components: a processor, RAM, and I/O interfaces. The processor interprets incoming requests for data to be provided or to be stored. The instructions and addressing required for data movement in or out is in RAM. The I/O component typically has at least one frontend port that communicates with the host computer's host adapter, and a backend port that links to the disk drives.</p>
<p>RAID systems commonly include <strong>battery-backed cache memory</strong>. This cache provides a buffer that enables the RAID controller to process data in either direction of I/O operations faster than its able to write it to a disk. The battery power enables the data to be retained in the event of a power failure. In larger RAID implementations, a <strong>redundant disk array controller</strong> (<strong>RDAC</strong>) that shares a dual-port connection with the primary disk array controller provides an immediate backup and failover should the primary fail. Without this redundancy, a failed disk array controller renders the disk array unreachable.</p>

<p>System and network administrators not only have the job of ensuring that a system or network keeps running and remains available to its users. Included in their duties are the tasks of managing, controlling, and allocating system resources. Hard disk space on a multi-user system may require usage limits to provide adequate storage space for all users. One way of accomplishing this is to set disk quotas.</p>
<p><strong>Disk quotas</strong>, which are set at user or group levels, limit the maximum size of single files or data blocks written to an HDD. Typically, a disk quota is specific to individual users or groups as one of two types of quota settings: user, or block, quotas or file, or inode (UNIX), quotas. A user quota limits an individual or group account to a specific maximum disk usage limit. File quotas limit the number and/or size of files created by a user or group.</p>
<p>In addition, disk quotas of either type are specific to a file system. Disk quotas can be set in most operating systems, including Windows (see the following screenshot), UNIX, and Linux:</p>

<p>Many administrators see disk compression as a means to reduce the amount of space data files take up on an HDD. Some even claim that disk compression may speed up the I/O process since the compression/decompression actions take place in RAM. Well, this is another place where the following Gilster's Law applies:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">"You never can tell, and it all depends."</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Disk compression, in general, may add a small amount of time to the I/O process, in either direction. Depending on the nature of the data stored in compressed form, the increase in the amount of data stored on a disk may mitigate the latency of the compression. On a high-volume I/O system, a compressed disk may not be the best solution. However, a data archive or warehouse, where I/O activity is low, is a much better candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Disk compression</strong> reduces the space that stored data uses on a disk medium. Disk compression, which is different from file compression, which compacts individual files, compresses all data written to the disk. When disk compression is enabled, a data compression utility that is between the operating system and the HDD controller intercepts any data written to or read from the affected HDD. The data is compressed or decompressed by the utility, as needed, and passed on.</p>

<p>An extremely important characteristic of a network server and all other network-connected systems is HA. A system that exhibits HA is operating and available a predominant percentage of the time. HA is measured in the percentage of uptime a system should or does realize. You may have heard the expression <em>four nines (9999)</em>. What this refers to is the number of digits to the right of the decimal when expressing the uptime percentage (as shown in the following table):</p>

<p>As shown in the previous table, what is meant by HA can vary with the purpose and use of a network server and the network-connected devices. Each supporting device on a network, such as RAID, NAS, SAN, <span class="ILfuVd"><strong>Routing and Remote Access Service</strong></span> (<strong>RRAS</strong>), and so on, typically has an HA expectation to both the data center administrators and its users. A goal of <em>9-nines</em> may be a bit too aggressive for most server operations, allowing only 31.56 milliseconds of downtime per year. However, many <strong>service level agreements</strong> (<strong>SLAs</strong>), or customer or subscriber support commitments, are typically for four or five-nines, committing to no more than 5-52 minutes of downtime a year. These commitments are either an average of the actual results experienced from a server or data center, or the aspirations of a network configuration built to provide a desired availability.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Where the goal of high availability is to keep a system available and accessible, the goal of <strong>fault tolerance</strong> is to retain all in-process data and operations in the event of a component or system failure. Tolerating a fault or failure is essential for any server or server-connected storage array. The level to which fault tolerance is incorporated into a system is dependent upon the nature of the services provided and the sensitivity of the data involved. A high-demand, around-the-clock system that must always be available combines high availability and fault tolerance principles. At the other end of the spectrum, the fault tolerance of a system may be more of a <em>soft landing</em> that provides the time needed to store all in-process data.</p>
<p>Any level of fault tolerance has three general characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is no single point of failure</strong>: Any element of a system that could possibly fail and take the system down is backed up by a failover or redundant element</li>
<li><strong>A component failure shouldn't require the system to stop</strong>: If a component fails, applying a replacement doesn't require any or all systems to be powered down</li>
<li><strong>Any fault or failure is easily identified and isolated</strong>: A failed component won't cause data or processing to be lost or interrupted</li>
</ul>
<p>These principles can be applied to any of the three major failure areas of any system: hardware, software, and power.</p>

<p>The capability to replace or take a failed component offline without impacting users or operations is the primary goal of both high availability and fault tolerance. Avoiding the need to power down the entire system to replace a failed component is the ultimate goal. However, it isn't necessary to shut down the whole system or just the failed component in all cases. Some components have the capability of being replaced <em>on the fly</em>. </p>
<p>In any case, there are three general types of failed hardware and power component replacement methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hot swapping</strong>: Hot swapping involves the immediate switchover or physical replacement of a failed component while a system is running and fully operational. Examples of hot swappable devices, referred to as <strong>hot spares</strong>, are audio devices, displays, USB devices, SATA drives, and network jacks.</li>
<li><strong>Warm swapping</strong>: Warm swapping requires the suspension of a system's, or failed component's, operations while a replacement or switchover takes place. In general, warm swapping involves media changes, rather than entire components.</li>
<li><strong>Cold swapping</strong>: Cold swapping involves completely shutting down a system to affect upgrades, replacements, or repairs by applying <strong>cold spares</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Forecasting how much data storage space a computer, system, or data center will need in the future, near or far, can be tricky. On the one hand, you don't want to bring in too much storage capacity unnecessarily and tie up money that you could use elsewhere. On the other hand, running out of storage space could mean system interruptions and higher last-minute prices. The trick is to find a happy medium where you will have the right amount of disk space over a specific time frame and a clear plan of when storage space should increase or decrease.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Most HDD manufacturers have disk capacity planning tools you can use to forecast your storage needs in the future. There are also several system management software packages that include a capacity planning function (see the following screenshot). However, before you begin forecasting future needs, be sure you understand where the disk storage demands will come from and what other technologies or approaches may address the capacity requirements. Disk storage technologies and methods such as tiered storage, data compression, virtualization, SAN, and NAS, may be a better and more economical way to go:</p>

<p>Other forms of data storage devices that just don't work for efficient data retrieval are appropriate for use in data backup, file archives, and disaster recovery. Of these, magnetic tape is perhaps the most commonly used medium for two reasons: portability and cost.</p>

<p><strong>Magnetic tape</strong> is a plastic or mylar strip that is coated with an iron oxide or chromium layer that can be magnetized or demagnetized to represent data bits, which are written to the tape in either a parallel or helical pattern of up to 128 tracks. Originally, magnetic tape was stored on reels, but today, it's generally packaged inside plastic cases (cartridges).</p>
<p>Data is written to or read from tape serially, which means that to retrieve data from the end of the tape, all the preceding data must be skipped. Historically, magnetic tape wasn't a medium for random access. However, newer technologies, such as the <strong>Linear Tape Open</strong> (<strong>LTO</strong>), perform like random access by storing data objects separately from their metadata. LTFS organization allows magnetic tape to store as much as 220 TB of data.</p>
<p>An enterprise or any other organization, typically stores its recorded tapes, whether for regular system backups, data archives, or disaster recovery, in a tape library.</p>
<p>A <strong>tape library</strong> can be an organized storage facility or cabinet, storing tapes in chronological, purpose, or content order. However, magnetic tape devices able to hold several tape cartridges that rotate sequentially on a set schedule are also known as tape libraries.</p>

<p>Another technology used for data backup, storing large files, transferring data or programming from one computer to another, or commercially packaged application software is optical data storage. An <strong>optical disc drive</strong> (<strong>ODD</strong>) reads from or writes to an optical disc, but, for the most part, optical discs are inputs.</p>
<p>Common examples of optical discs are <strong>compact discs</strong> (<strong>CDs</strong>), <strong>digital versatile/video discs</strong> (<strong>DVDs</strong>), and Blu-ray discs. Optical discs were at one time considered a better option than most portable magnetic media. A CD can store as much as 700 MB of data; a DVD can hold up to 8.4 GB; and a Blu-ray disk may contain as much as 50 GB. However, with USB flash memory drives (thumb drives/flash drives) now storing as much as 256 GB, optical drives may have a limited capability as backup media.</p>

<p>Form factors set the form and fit of a computer's case, motherboard, power supply, and disk storage drive, the form factor sets the height, width, length, and the type and placement of its connector to the host computer. HDD device specifications include RPM, interface, access time, throughput, and IOPS. An HDD is a serial device and an SSD is a random-access device.</p>
<p>An SSD stores data in solid-state semiconductor chips and has no moving parts. SSDs use a SAS or SATA interface. Disk drive interfaces are word-serial or bit-serial and bit-oriented interfaces that connect through HBA, FC, SATA, and SAS. PATA uses parallel bit signaling . SATA uses serial bit signaling. SCSI provides a multiple-connection interface for several devices. SAS expands SCSI. NAS is clustered storage devices that appear as a network share. SAN is a network of storage devices and switches providing access to connected network nodes. A LUN identifies a unit of SAN storage. Data is organized on secondary storage in a filesystem. SMB assists applications to access files and network resources on a network. SMB has different versions or dialects that are unique to specific OSes, such as CIFS.</p>
<p>RAID systems are built on two or more HDD or SSD volumes that operate synchronously. Striping and mirroring are the methods a RAID system uses to create data redundancy. Striping separates data into stripes stored on two or more disk drives. Mirroring duplicates data onto two or more drives. RAID levels incorporate striping or mirroring, or both, and may also apply parity. RAID 0 uses striping but isn't a redundancy method. RAID 1 provides mirroring that's available if a disk drive fails or data becomes corrupted. RAID 5 is like RAID 0 with parity added and uses striped data and parity information to recreate a data block on a failing drive. RAID 6 is the equivalent RAID 5 with the parity information doubled and is common in larger networks. RAID Level 1+0 or 10 combines the mirroring of Level 1 with the striping of Level 0, but without parity. Hardware RAID is implemented by a controller card in a host server, a standalone RAID appliance, or through HDDs with embedded controllers. Disk compression reduces the space data requires on a disk medium. Disk compression is different from file compression. A data compression utility between the OS and HDD intercepts data being passed and compresses or decompresses it as needed and passes it on.</p>

<p>HA is the uptime condition of a system that is available a significant percentage of the time. Fault-tolerant systems are able to continue operating in the event of a component or system failure. Hot swapping is the immediate switchover or replacement of a failed component completed while a system remains fully operational. Warm swapping requires the suspension of operations, although still powered, to affect the replacement of a failed component. Cold swapping requires the powering down of a system to affect replacements or repairs. Other media and storage devices may be used to store data, including magnetic tape and optical storage.</p>
