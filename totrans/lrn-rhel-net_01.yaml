- en: Welcome to the world of enterprise-level Linux version 7\. This was first introduced
    to us on June 9, 2014\. Red Hat started its journey with Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    (RHEL) 7 with its beta release on December 11, 2013\. This was followed by the
    next release candidate on April 23\. Finally, as expected, the gold release reached
    the market on June 2014\. Currently, at the time of writing this book, we have
    Update 1 in the beta release. During the course of this book, this is what we
    will use for demonstration purposes.

    other bleeding edge distributions. It will also help you understand the relationship
    between Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora. We also hope that this short chapter will
    give you a great understanding on how to use RHEL 7 on your hardware platform
    of choice. The topics for this chapter are broken down as follows:'

- en: When we think of Linux, more often than not, Red Hat will be a primary consideration;
    almost certainly, if we are working at a corporate level, Red Hat will become
    part of our estate. Reliability, predictability, and stability are words synonymous
    with this very profitable and successful organization. To give an idea of their
    recent success, the company's share price on the Nasdaq (RHT) in 2010 was less
    than $30\. However, towards the end of 2014, their value hovered around $60.

- en: Enterprise Linux is not likely to be on the bleeding edge. As an enterprise
    distribution, it has to be supportable and reliable. With the release of RHEL
    7, we have seen the first use of version 3 of the Linux kernel within RHEL. The
    Linux kernel version 3 saw the light of day on July 22, 2011\. So, we can say
    that enterprise Linux may be some 3-4 years behind the latest and greatest version.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many respects, the reliability aspect takes precedence over the new kernel
    features that version 3 will offer. These features often relate to hardware and
    are not important because the enterprise-level hardware has to take a similar
    cautious approach within mission critical environments. We find that enterprise-level
    hardware has to be reliable and this leads to, perhaps, a lack of new untested
    features. Development of new hardware and drivers that reside in the kernel can
    be tested on smaller businesses and home users. These beta testers can go through
    the torment while the developments can be improved for our mission-critical servers.
    A blue chip enterprise company demands a level of support that goes beyond posting
    a technical query within a support forum and hoping that someone will see it and
    respond to it. Almost certainly, any financial organization will have to be able
    to prove their level of support for their systems. This is most easily achieved
    by presenting your support agreement or contract and the associated service level
    agreement or SLA. To this end, Red Hat is not free, but the payment is taken for
    support and not for the distribution purpose. The simplest level of support starts
    at around $350 (US dollars) per year.

    the support was provided for 10 years, but has been extended to 13 years with
    RHEL 7\. This means that the support for RHEL 7 can extend to June 30, 2027\.
    The current RHEL 7.1 beta version uses the Linux kernel 3.10.0-210 compared to
    3.10.0-123 with the 7.0 release. Here, we see tiny increments in the kernel version
    indicative of the care taken in rolling out any version of RHEL. At the time of
    writing, the very latest Linux kernel available from maintainers ([https://www.kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org))
    is version 3.18.1.

- en: '**CentOS** (**Community Enterprise Operating System**) has been commonly used
    and totally free of charge as a Red Hat rebuild for many years. This is where
    Red Hat logos and branding are removed from the system and redistributed as "CentOS".
    This is not quite as bad as it may first seem. Red Hat uses the open source code
    and redistribution is totally within the remit of the **GPL** (**GNU Public License**)
    agreement. What you lose out on is support. So, you may well find CentOS more
    used within smaller business operations and academia (where external support is
    not as critical). Support for CentOS is available only through public forums.
    Of course, this means that there is no guaranteed service level available.'

    free of charge product it brings on the market replicates the same reliability
    and predictability of its Red Hat cousin. The relationship between Red Hat and
    CentOS was more formalized in January 2014\. The governance panel at CentOS now
    includes Red Hat board members among their numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CentOS does not release beta versions in the same way as Red Hat. This means
    that the latest version available from the CentOS stable is version 7.0\. This
    will use the same kernel and version 3.10.0-123 as the RHEL 7.0 distribution.
    The close resemblance between CentOS and Red Hat often means that CentOS becomes
    a perfect study platform for those wishing to learn Red Hat and, perhaps, gain
    their certifications. This is certainly a very viable option and the same applies
    to studying this book. Although, we will be using RHEL 7.1 beta, if you want to
    use CentOS, this should be very similar and mostly compatible with CentOS 7.

- en: As CentOS does not offer subscription support, this in turn affects the product
    life cycle. To obtain the entire 13 years of support that RHEL 7 offers, a RHEL
    customer will have to purchase extended support for the final 3 years coverage.
    This means that CentOS has repositories that will distribute updates for 10 years,
    resulting in the fact that CentOS 7 can continually be updated until June 2024\.
    Not bad at all when you see it like this and all without financial cost.

- en: We can say that Fedora is the home version of Red Hat. Although we have marked
    this as a home version, Fedora ships in a server version and it's your choice
    as to how and where you use Fedora. The support for newer laptops and the latest
    hardware is going to be far greater. This then often makes it a target for home
    users and enthusiasts. The current version is Fedora 21 and uses almost all the
    very latest kernel with version 3.17.4-301.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other advantage of using Fedora, even if not in a production format, is
    that you become familiar with technologies. These technologies will become enterprise-ready
    at some point. In this way, you will learn as the product is developed. For example,
    RHEL 7 is based around Fedora 19 and 20\. If you have been an enthusiastic Fedora
    champion, you will already be familiar with GRUB2, BTRFS, docker, and systemd
    (all of which debut in RHEL 7).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Support for Fedora is community-driven with software updates available for about
    13 months from the initial product launch. For example, Fedora 21 will be supported
    for 1 month after the release of Fedora 23\. The release dates are about every
    6 months, which gives us an approximate support life of 13 months. This is often
    why Fedora (and similar distributions to Fedora) do not make it to the enterprise
    category because of such a short update life cycle.

    what you are actually installing. If you can't, then we have some issues we need
    to resolve before the installation. Often though, you may be faced with a machine
    that is preinstalled or a lab machine that you may have access to. An obvious
    first step to any faultfinding task will be to determine the actual OS and patch
    level that we will work on. We will now look at the many ways that exist to determine
    the flavor of Linux that you will use.
