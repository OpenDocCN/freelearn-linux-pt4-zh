    components can also have issues, which are usually at a minimum disruptive or,
    at the extreme, catastrophic. Your ability to troubleshoot, resolve, and document
    hardware issues directly impacts just how disruptive a hardware issue may be.
    In this chapter, we will look at PC hardware problems that occur relatively frequently.
    These problems are those that you are likely to see in your role as a certified
    server administrator.

- en: Hardware problems can be a fault in or related to an electrical or electronic
    component, or possibly the setup, installation, or configuration of a component,
    which leads to the malfunction or failure of an entire computer. However, what
    may appear to be a hardware problem can be a software-caused issue. At the risk
    of being obvious, a major difference between a hardware problem and a software
    problem is that a hardware problem typically requires you to open or remove the
    system case, as opposed to simply applying a patch.

- en: As we discussed earlier, a failure during the POST phase of the boot process
    can cause the startup process to stop. Although POST communicates any problems
    it detects, the form of that communication varies among BIOS/UEFI versions. Both
    Windows PCs and macOS computers run a POST process as an initial part of the startup
    or boot process. The POST verifies the presence and functionality of essential
    components and devices, such as the **power supply unit** (**PSU**), main memory
    (RAM), and the system bus structure, among others. Should any of these devices
    not respond to the POST, a pattern of audible beep tones will sound out to alert
    the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the POST is running, the only output device that's available is the system
    speaker. For this reason, POST uses a pattern of short or long beep sounds to
    indicate any problem it has found. These codes are generally unique to the manufacturer
    of the motherboard or computer. There is no standard set of beep codes and each
    manufacturer has its own unique set. So, a technician working in an environment
    with PCs from several manufacturers may need to be multi-beep savvy.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A computer overheats for a variety of reasons, but generally, it's caused by
    neglected preventive maintenance. Dust building up on the air vents and grills
    and inside the system case can block or restrict the airflow that was designed
    to cool the heat-emitting components. Heat inside the system case that slowly
    rises above its safe operating limits can also slowly cause the electronic components
    on the motherboard and installed devices to deteriorate. The damage comes from
    a heat buildup caused by the dust creating an insulating layer and trapping heat
    that can't escape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another factor that can contribute to a computer's overheating problem is a
    combination of its location and the ventilation and airflow it has. A well-ventilated
    space provides a base environment that provides for the underlying conditions
    that are assumed in the engineering of the computer's cooling system. Other factors
    include direct sunlight, closeness to exterior windows, or furniture or objects
    obstructing the airflow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The resolution for a computer with an overheating problem, either intermittent
    or persistent, is to basically reverse the conditions causing the computer to
    overheat. Clean the inside of the system case with compressed air to blow any
    layers of dust away from any cooling system vents, fans, heat sinks, and air passages.
    You can vacuum the dust, but make sure you're using a vacuum cleaner that doesn't
    create or emit static electricity. In other words, don't use your household vacuum!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If cleaning doesn't resolve the problem, check the location and its access to
    the ambient ventilation system. Moving the computer out of direct sunlight and
    away from anything blocking the airflow is your next step. And, if this doesn't
    solve the problem, you may have a malfunctioning case fan, the heat sink or CPU
    fan is wrong, or the thermal paste is too much or too little. You'll need to work
    through these issues one at a time to eliminate them as possible causes.

- en: If the microprocessor in a computer fails, it's a very good indication of some
    other problems—not that it matters at that point. There are only a few reasons
    why a processor would fail, such as an extreme power surge or lightning strike,
    bungled attempts to overclock the CPU, or the accumulated damage of overheating.
    Most processors now include a protection mechanism that slows down or halts it
    completely if its operating temperature rises too high. While this feature does
    protect the processor against sudden and significant temperature increases, over
    the long term, a processor, especially one that's heavily used, can slowly begin
    to fail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Monitoring the temperature of the CPU on a new commercially assembled computer
    can set a reliable baseline. However, if you were to install a new CPU or cooling
    devices, any unnoticed misalignment or improper application could create a false
    baseline. Checking the system regularly against this baseline is essentially keeping
    track of the **time to failure** (**TTF**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, *how do you* *take the temperature of a CPU?* And *what should the* *temperature
    be?* It does vary a bit from processor to processor, but the rule of thumb is
    that a processor should normally operate in the range of 45^o to 50^o **Celsius**
    (**C**), which is 113^o to 122^o**Fahrenheit** (**F**). Under a full load, such
    as playing a game, the CPU should not exceed 750 C (167^o F). Some processors
    can run at a higher temperature, but not for very long before damaging the CPU.

    and electrolytic capacitors. A transformer in a computer's power supply decreases
    the voltage of the incoming electrical power. The *stepped down* power then passes
    through a rectifier that converts it from AC to DC. Since AC power fluctuates,
    the DC power that's produced by the rectifier also fluctuates. A capacitor, also
    known as an electrolytic capacitor or condenser, stores a static electrical charge.

    It's common for a motherboard to include multiple expansion bus standards to provide
    backward compatibility and component flexibility. The expansion buses on most
    current motherboards are the **Accelerated Graphics Port** (**AGP**), **Peripheral
    Component Interconnect** (**PCI**), **PCI Expanded** (**PCI-X**), and **PCI Express**
    (**PCIe**). The PCI bus is the most popular and is found on PC and Macintosh motherboards.

    firmly seat the card into the expansion slot (with the power off, of course).

    cards. So, if there is a problem with the card, it generally shows up on the supported
    device.

    a condition that may appear to be an issue with an expansion card can occur when
    the motherboard and chipset include the same function as an installed expansion

    and electrolytic capacitors. A transformer decreases the voltage of the incoming
    electrical power, which a rectifier then converts from AC to DC. A capacitor stores
    a static electrical charge, which the ESR uses to *step up* dips in the current.
    A failing capacitor bulges its top, leaks out its electrolytic material, or catches
    fire.
