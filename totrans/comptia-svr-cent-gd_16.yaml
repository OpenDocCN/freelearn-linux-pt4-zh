    the access control we talk about in the context of logical security, while different

- en: Access control is a method of logical security that identifies what resources
    an individual user may access, modify, create, or remove. Using access controls,
    a system administrator can allow or restrict access to certain system assets and
    resources on an individual or group basis. Each authenticated and authorized user
    or group is assigned a **security identifier** (**SID**), which is the identity
    of a system record that details the access permissions and rights of a user or
    group; that is, their security principals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a user, as an individual or as a member of a group, requests access to
    a system resource or asset, the SID record informs the **operating system** (**OS**)
    of the access permissions and rights that are granted to that user. Typically,
    the requested access comes in the form of an attempt to read or write the resource.
    In response, the OS scans the corresponding SID to determine whether it can permit
    the requested access.

    in use has been decrypted and typically copied to memory for a logical operation.
    Data in transit needs protection from a variety of interception techniques (all
    of which are bad) as it moves across transmission lines. The same—if not more
    robust—protection is also a must for sensitive or confidential data that's stored
    on some form of data storage media, such as a hard disk, a flash drive, or perhaps
    even magnetic tape.

    levels of secured data. Encryption has applications on virtually all levels of
    a storage device, including an entire hard disk drive and, in some cases, removable
    media. **Full-disk encryption** (**FDE**) essentially creates a passageway between
    the storage medium and main memory. As data passes to the disk for storage, it
    is encrypted. As data is transferred to be placed in memory, it's decrypted. Virtually,
    the same encryption/decryption process may protect a disk partition, a filesystem,
    an individual file, or an individual data element, such a column, row, or cell

    to tampering. Application software can be subject to reverse-engineering, intrusion,
    and in some cases, code insertion. Not only does the hardening process protect
    the application code itself, but in many cases, it protects the data from being
    accessed by the application. Common threats to application software include the
    discovery of a vulnerability, virus and other malware attacks, and possibly theft
    of the application and data.

    two terminating points: an entry point and an endpoint. An entry point opens at
    the client end of the connection, and the server (its interface port) becomes
    the endpoint. Endpoint security has rapidly become an issue due to the increase
    of **b****ring your own device** (**BYOD**) policies in a growing number of companies.

    Regardless, an IDS scans network traffic (inbound or outbound) to identify malware
    or, a pattern of suspicious behavior, and monitoring system configuration settings
    for inadvertent changes. An endpoint IDS is a **security information and event
    management** (**SIEM**) application that monitors, scans, and gathers information
    on the endpoint's traffic. Some IDSes allow for performance and event thresholds
    above which an alert can go to the administrator. On a network, the endpoint and
    entry point IDS devices are designated as **network-based intrusion detection system**
    (**NIDS**) or **host-based intrusion detection system** (**HIDS**). A NIDS is
    an independent device that monitors network traffic before it's passed to a network
    device. A HIDS can be either hardware or software that's attached to, or running
    on, a host computer.

    not malware) or a false negative (not a match, yet the message is invalid and
    possibly malware), but otherwise the IDS may block the source address from entering
    the network.

    create, or remove. Access controls allow or restrict access to system assets and
    resources. In larger organizations, the criteria to assign permissions may come
    from different identification factors, such as a group, a role, a location, a
    time, day or date, or a transaction type, or the application in use.

    rights and permissions. Each file or object has an ACE that defines its permissions
    for its owner, group, and other users. Each level may have read, write, and execute
    permissions. Access control for devices is done through administrator passwords,
    the application of patches and upgrades, disabling unused features, limiting access,

    The different types of hardening are OS hardening, system hardening, application
    hardening, and hardware hardening. Hardening an OS involves disabling unneeded
    services and unused TCP/UDP ports, installing only the required software, and
    applying patches and updates. In addition, hardening may include removing unused
    software, auditing group and user permissions, exercising patch management, and
    establishing and monitoring baselines.

    user account policies, implementing a strong password policy, adhering to physical
    security policies, activating system logging, and disabling file and device sharing.
    Application hardening changes the binary code of the application to make it resistant
    to tampering, reverse-engineering, intrusion, and code insertion. Hardware hardening
    on a host system is done through BIOS/UEFI configuration settings, including setting
    a BIOS/UEFI password, disabling WoL, and setting the boot sequence to eliminate
    a remote boot. Hardening network devices includes backing up device configurations,
    disabling unused administrative protocols and services, encrypting configuration
    files, and securing access.
