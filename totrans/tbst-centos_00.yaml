- en: CentOS (Community Enterprise Operating System) is known as a robust, stable,
    and generally trouble-free operating system that is particularly well-suited to
    the role of a server. As a faithful adaption of RHEL, CentOS has been with us
    since its initial release in May 2004\. It is used by a significant number of
    servers across the world, by an increasing number of individuals and businesses
    for a variety of needs, and it can be found in many mission critical situations.
    CentOS is considered to be a favorite among Linux professionals, and if it is
    configured correctly, serviced, and maintained, in most instances, a CentOS-based
    server should never give rise to any major complications. However, there are occasions
    when things do go wrong, and in such a situation, where the old joke of "rebooting
    the machine" is not the most appropriate form of action, then your only recourse
    is to consider troubleshooting the system.

    of this book is to take you on a journey across the whole spectrum of issue-based
    problem solving. Active processes, the networking environment, package management,
    users, directories and files, shared resources, security, databases, web-based
    services, and DNS will all be encountered with the sole purpose of building your
    knowledge base and enabling you to develop a fresh approach to problem solving.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The requirement of this book is based on the use of CentOS 7, a community-supported
    distribution derived from sources freely provided to the public by Red Hat. As
    such, CentOS Linux is functionally compatible with RHEL (**Red** **Hat** **Enterprise**
    **Linux**), although some package names may have been changed in order to remove
    upstream vendor branding and artwork. CentOS Linux is available for free, at no
    cost, and free to redistribute.

- en: This is a practical guide used to troubleshoot the CentOS 7 community-based
    enterprise server. It is assumed that you already have a server up and running,
    a good working knowledge of CentOS, and that you are comfortable with the concept
    of working with the services used by your server. You are not expected to be an
    expert by any means, but the familiarity of working with a server by remote administration
    will always help.
