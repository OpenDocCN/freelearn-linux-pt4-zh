- en: First, you'll learn about Linux shells and why we chose the bash shell. Then,
    you'll learn how to write a simple bash script and how to edit your bash script
    using Linux editors.

    a variable. After this, you will learn how to store command execution output into
    a variable, which is called command substitution. Also, you will learn how to
    debug your code using bash options and Visual Studio Code. You will learn how
    to make your bash script interactive to the user by accepting input from the user
    using the read command. Then, you will learn how to read options and its values
    if the user passed them to the script. Following this, you will learn how to write
    conditional statements such as if statements and how to use case statements. After
    this, you will learn how to create code snippets using vim and Visual Studio Code.
    For repetitive tasks, you will see how to write for loops, how to iterate over
    simple values, and how to iterate over directory content. Also, you will learn
    how to write nested loops. Along with this, you will write while and until loops.
    Then, we will move on to functions, the reusable chunks of code. You will learn
    how to write functions and how to use them. After this, you will be introduced
    to one of the best tools in Linux, which is Stream Editor. As we are still talking
    about text processing, we will introduce AWK, one of the best text processing
    tools in Linux that you will ever see.

    better regular expressions. Finally, you will be introduced to Python as an alternative
    to bash scripting.
