    for its information, analysis, application, and media, as well as email, web access,
    scheduling, and personal productivity applications. In most cases, the network
    has become integrated into the fabric of these organizations with its availability
    taken for granted. However, when a technical problem causes the network to go
    down, network administrators must identify the problem, resolve it, and assure
    its integrity—all in as little time as possible.

    a reserved Class B address group of `169.254.0.0/16`. The purpose of the APIPA
    configuration is to allow the booking process and IP configuration to complete,
    so the host can operate on the local network. Routers don't forward APIPA addresses,

    is dependent on the configuration of any switches on the LAN.

    discards the message after reaching one router (hop) and only the first router
    on the path responds with the echo message. `tracert` then sends out another ICMP
    echo request, this time with a TTL value of 2\. This process repeats until the
    TTL runs out (meaning the number of hops equals the default hop count), or until
    no incremental hops respond.

    Mounting a device adds it to the active directory structure and makes its contents
    available for access. To dismount a mounted device or filesystem, the `umount` command
    notifies the operating system to complete any I/O operations to that unit and
    then remove it from the directory structure. Both the `net` and `mount` commands
    are available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

    a link to fail, including cables, connections, NICs, gateways, and the ISP. A
    common problem is the configuration of hardware and software. Areas where configuration
    issues are common include the DHCP server, email server and clients, the `hosts`
    file, NICs, routers and switches, VLANs, default gateways, and firewalls.
