It is affordable enough for people to use for all sorts of different projects that weren't possible before. Some of these projects range from creating a media center for your TV to the autopilot functionality in an unmanned aerial vehicle.</p><p>Many of these projects are based on Raspbian, and many of these have become their own distribution. They are still Raspbian at heart, but they have been customized for a specific purpose, and you can use the skills that you have learned from this book to work with them. This chapter runs through some of the different distributions.</p><div class="section" title="Raspbmc"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec57"/>Raspbmc</h1></div></div></div><p>Raspbmc (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">http://www.raspbmc.com/</a>) is a Linux<a class="indexterm" id="id481"/> distribution based on Raspbian that lets you<a class="indexterm" id="id482"/> run XBMC (now called Kodi) on your Raspberry Pi. Kodi is an award-winning media player and entertainment hub <a class="indexterm" id="id483"/>designed to run on as many different devices as possible, including the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Thanks to the Broadcom <a class="indexterm" id="id484"/>CPU and VideoCore IV graphics engine, the Raspberry Pi has more than enough power to handle media playback. This allows you to turn your Raspberry Pi into a powerful, extremely low-cost media center with low power consumption.</p><p>By installing Raspbmc on your Raspberry Pi, you can turn your Raspberry Pi into a fully-featured media center that can play movies and music on your TV. Kodi lets you use any smartphone or tablet with Wi-Fi as a remote control.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Raspbmc" src="graphics/2192OS_07_01.jpg"/></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Volumio"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec58"/>Volumio</h1></div></div></div><p>Volumio (<a class="ulink" href="http://volumio.org/">http://volumio.org/</a>) is a <a class="indexterm" id="id485"/>free, open source Linux distribution based on Raspbian, designed to turn a Raspberry Pi into an<a class="indexterm" id="id486"/> audiophile music player. Volumio is designed to be easy to use. To quote the Volumio website, Volumio can be defined as follows:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Volumio is designed to be simple. To sound amazing. To be what your music deserves."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>After installing Volumio<a class="indexterm" id="id487"/> onto your Raspberry Pi, you can control the music that you are playing using any smartphone or tablet with Wi-Fi.</p><p>The interesting thing about Volumio is that, as it has been designed for use by audiophiles (people who enjoy high-quality audio), it is designed to be able to use<a class="indexterm" id="id488"/> external <span class="strong"><strong>digital-to-analog converters</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>D/A</strong></span>) to increase the quality of the sound being played. These D/A converters plug into your Raspberry Pi and work as a very high-quality sound card.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec63"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you learned about several different operating systems that are based on Raspbian. These operating systems build on Raspbian to make your Raspberry Pi able to perform specialized tasks. These are only a small subset of some of the distributions available for the Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the popularity of the Raspberry Pi, more and more of these distributions will become available.</p><p>The skills that this book has taught you will help you with these distributions and allow you to make the most of them. Good luck!</p></div></body></html>
