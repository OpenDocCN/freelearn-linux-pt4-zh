    of a file purposefully or accidentally. Monitoring the integrity of stored data

    boot up and these services may start up other services (dependencies). A part
    of the security procedures on any server should be a periodical audit of the services
    actively running on it. The services audit should also note which TCP/UDP ports
    are in use and by which services. More active services can mean more vulnerabilities
    and threats. The information gained in the services audit can also help to structure
    the network''s firewall and router rules. On a Windows system, list the active
    services using the `net start` command (see the following screenshot):'

    that scans and protects all of the network''s nodes automatically. But, the quality
    of that protection is a direct product of the anti-malware system''s configuration.

    it is to get its **process ID** (**PID**) first. In Windows, use the Task Manager
    (where you can also try to end it all) and in Linux or macOS, the `ps` command
    lists this information. The following screenshots show the PID numbers in the
    Windows Task Manager and a Linux `ps` command, respectively. With the PID, you

    objective. Attackers use sniffers to obtain passwords, usernames, account numbers,
    and other **personally identifiable information** (**PII**). Sniffers can be hardware
    appliances or software programs. A **snoop server** is a sniffer configured in
    promiscuous mode, which captures and examines all network traffic. Only the destination
