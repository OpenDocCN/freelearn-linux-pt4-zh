<p>Known by many names, the CPU (also known as the microprocessor, processor, brains, and other names), is the electronic component that runs program instructions, performs arithmetic functions, and controls the movement of data and the input and output functions of peripheral devices attached to or installed on the computer. But then, you knew all of that.</p>
<p>For the Server+ exam, what you need to know is less about how a CPU functions and more about its characteristics, including its mounting socket, clock speeds, cores, stepping, and more. So, let's get on with it.</p>

<p>A multiprocessor environment is a single computer system that has two or more integrated CPUs. The CPUs share the computer's memory, bus, and other resources. The CPUs work cooperatively to execute program instructions in series, with one CPU performing an instruction and the other CPUs simultaneously performing another. The purpose and result of this process is that the computer runs faster than a single processor (uniprocessor):</p>

<p>The CPUs in a multiprocessor system can be set up for either symmetrical or asymmetrical multiprocessing. In SMP, the CPUs equally share the operating system, main memory, bus, and input/output drivers and devices. The goal of an SMP system is to balance the computing loads between the processors and speed up processing. However, it's recommended that an SMP includes no more than 16 processors.</p>
<p>In ASMP, one CPU is the master and all other CPUs are slaves. The master handles the operating system tasks and assigns process requests to the slaves. Slaves can be general-purpose or dedicated to a specific processing responsibility. The master processor controls the functions of the system with the assistance, when necessary, of the slaves.</p>

<p>Multiple processor systems can perform <em>parallel processing</em>, in which each of its processors executes the same instruction or a unique set of instructions on either the same dataset or on several datasets. Today's multiprocessing computers support different flavors of parallel processing, with the three primary forms being:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD)</strong>: Multiple processors execute the same instruction on different blocks of a data source. SIMD speeds up multimedia processing.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-instruction, single-data (MISD)</strong>: Multiple processors execute different instructions on a single data source. MISD computing is not common because this mode of parallel processing is usually very specific to a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-instruction, multiple-data (MIMD)</strong>: Multiple processors execute different instructions on different blocks of a data source. MIMD is what most people think of as parallel computing.</li>

<p>Where multiprocessing involves multiple microprocessors as parts of a single unit, multicore processing is one microprocessor that contains multiple processors or cores. Each core is a microprocessor and can process a different stream of instructions than any of the other cores on the same <strong>integrated circuit</strong> (<strong>IC</strong>) chip.</p>
<p>If you have a quad-core processor, you have four separate processors built into your CPU. This means that you can be checking your email, watching a video, working on your budget in a spreadsheet, and listening to a music stream all at the same time. Each of these actions runs separately on its own core:</p>

<p>The shape and construction of a CPU is its packaging. Virtually all server CPUs are in <strong>Land Grid Array</strong> (<strong>LGA</strong>) packaging. In this packaging, the mounting pins are a part of the socket and the CPU has receiving holes (ports) to fit over each pin. The following image shows the ports on the underside of a CPU in an LGA package:</p>

<p>A cache (pronounced <em>cash</em>), according to dictionary folks, is anything you <em>store away in hiding for future use</em>. In a computer system, there are several types of cache:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser cache</strong>: When you download a web page, the browser stores some or all of the page's content, especially the parts that aren't likely to change, such as images, headlines, text, scripts, and so on. This eliminates the need to download this content again as you page through the website.</li>
<li><strong>Disk cache</strong>: Many larger hard disk drives include a small amount of RAM, which functions as a cache. For example, a 1 TB hard disk drive has 32 MB of disk cache to improve the disk's I/O performance.</li>
<li><strong>Memory cache</strong>: Not to be confused with the processor cache, application software that requires a large amount of data, such as a graphics editor, will create a cache in RAM to reduce I/O operations and speed up processing.</li>
<li><strong>Processor cache</strong>: In the context of CPUs and servers, this type of cache (also known as CPU memory or cache memory) provides data and instructions to the CPU, eliminating the need to access the slower main memory. There is more on this in the following section.</li>
</ul>

<p>A CPU has a small amount of memory reserved for its use. This memory, which is known as CPU memory or cache memory, consists of multiple levels of <strong>static RAM</strong> (<strong>SRAM</strong>), most typically three levels, as shown in the following diagram in this section. The purpose of this cache of memory is to provide data and instructions to the CPU at a much faster rate than if these inputs were to come from main memory DRAM. The CPU's caching system also tries to guess ahead as to what the CPU will request next and, based on current processing, is right more often than not, which speeds things up more:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-955 image-border" src="Images/04c8d462-1e6c-45ee-968b-f960f017d7ce.jpg" style="width:39.92em;height:6.83em;" width="995" height="171"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Caching provides a fast, multilevel buffer for the CPU</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Cache memories have a couple of important characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporal (time) locality</strong>: Cache memory holds images, data, and instructions that are unchanging, which eliminates the need to fetch them from their source or main memory.</li>
<li><strong>Spatial (sequence) locality</strong>: Commonly, the next CPU request for an instruction or data block is already in a cache. If the CPU requests something not in the cache, a <em>cache miss</em> occurs. If the CPU requests a cached item, it's a <em>cache hit</em>, which is a more common event.</li>

<p>As illustrated in the <em>CPU cache memory</em> section, most CPU systems include three levels of cache memory. <strong>Level 3</strong> (<strong>L3</strong>) cache is slow, but faster than main memory, and is the larger in size of the three levels. <strong>Level 2</strong> (<strong>L2</strong>) is faster than L3, but smaller in size. And <strong>Level 1</strong> (<strong>L1</strong>) is the fastest of all three levels and the smallest in size.</p>
<p>As shown previously, <span>in the</span> <em>CPU cache memory</em> <span>section</span>, instructions and data pass from main memory to L3, which is large enough to contain enough of the active program or data to predictably include the next request from L2 and above. Multi-core processors typically share L3 cache memory. L2 applies spatial locality to predict what L1 will ask for and requests a block from L3, which contains the predicted items. L1 continues this process by predicting more precisely the item it anticipates the CPU to request next and asks L2 for that item.</p>

<p>Cache memory systems take advantage of the time when the CPU may be idle—we're talking about milliseconds here—to write data passed down to it from the CPU or a higher cache level. The data is passed to main memory or directly to a secondary storage device. This action is called <strong>write-back</strong>.</p>
<p>In some instances, the CPU writes data directly to main memory or a storage device. When this happens, the CPU also passes the data to cache memory. This action is called <strong>write-through</strong>. The extra write step slows the process, but if the next CPU request results in a cache hit, the system realizes a time benefit.</p>

<p>It seems like the Intel x86 family of processors has been the heart and brains of networking from the beginning. That's not a bad thing. It's just that there may be a new kid on the block—an ARM. A <strong>Reduced Instruction Set Computer</strong> (<strong><span>RISC</span></strong><span>)</span> is a specialized technology that involves the use of a more powerful instruction set with fewer commands. Cell phones and other mobile devices rely on ARM processors for many of their memory-and storage-related functions.</p>
<p>Because of its reduced instruction set, an ARM processor, which tends to be smaller in size than conventional processors, is readily adapted to a processor core. Servers that now run on processors with up to 12 cores can run equally as well on an ARM, which may involve dozens of less sophisticated processors that can share the computing task. While 12 processors result in substantial server, in x86 server, the processors could still become a bottleneck, depending on its loads.</p>

<p>CPUs are very fast in comparison to their support systems. Their speed or frequency (measured in MHz) is a function of the computer's <strong>front-side bus</strong> (<strong>FSB</strong>), which is the bus that connects the CPU with the northbridge (memory controller hub) of the chipset. To set its internal frequency, the CPU applies a multiplier to the actual frequency of the FSB.</p>
<p>The multiplier is a ratio, referred to as the CPU multiplier, clock multiplier, or the clock ratio, that's applied to the frequency of the FSB to determine and set the internal frequency of the CPU. For a 100 MHz CPU with a 40 times (40X) multiplier defined in its BIOS, the internal clock rate of the CPU is 4.0 GHz.</p>
<p>The CPU multiplier is the key to overclocking or under-clocking a computer. To overclock a computer, common in gaming, raise the value of the multiplier. To under-clock a computer, which means to slow it down, lower the multiplier's value. Overclocking typically requires additional cooling capacity and under-clocking saves the battery in a portable device.</p>

<p><strong>CPU stepping</strong> refers to revisions and revision numbers applied to a CPU to fix bugs or improve functionality. When a manufacturer releases a new CPU, its revision level is generally zero or a variation of zero, such as <strong>A0</strong>. For example, Intel, which calls revision releases, specification updates, and raises the revision level or step. AMD releases <em>revision numbers</em>, each of which has a higher revision number than the last.</p>

<p>Random-access memory or RAM allows data, instructions, addresses, or state information to be located and accessed directly. Each byte in RAM is addressable and accessed by itself or in a block of data. Its random-access capability contributes to the overall speed of the computer. The types of RAM are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic RAM</strong> (<strong>DRAM</strong>) is electrically volatile and must receive a refresher electrical charge periodically in order to hold its status (positive or negative). RAM consists of millions of single electronic components (transistors), each of which is able to store only a single value, which we represent with one of the two binary values—<kbd>0</kbd> or <kbd>1</kbd>. RAM consists of millions of transistors that can hold either a positive or negative charge.</li>
<li><strong>Static RAM</strong> (<strong>SRAM</strong>) is non-volatile, which means it doesn't require refreshing, and is able to hold its electrical charge as long as the computer has power. After the power is off, SRAM loses its stored charges along with the data it represents.</li>

<p>Like processors, RAM has moved through some evolutionary stages as well. Here's a bit of the timeline for RAM:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</strong>: The one characteristic of DRAM that led to its demise was that it operated independently of the processor, which could introduce latency when either component was waiting on the other.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)</strong>: SDRAM coordinated its operations with control signals on the system bus, which allowed it to stay one step ahead. However, SDRAM was <strong>single data-rate</strong> (<strong>SDR</strong>), meaning in a system clock cycle, it could only read or write once, on either the start or end of a clock cycle. With processors becoming more complicated and especially faster, SDRAM proved to be too slow.</li>
<li><strong>DDR-SDRAM</strong>: DDR memory improved on the SDR technology by allowing data I/O on both the start and end of the clock cycle, doubling the data rate.</li>
<li><strong>DDR2/DDR3</strong>: These two technologies incorporated internal clocks that operated at one half (DDR2) and one fourth (DDR3) of the original DDR memory. DDR3 improved memory size to as much as 8 GB, increased the data rate to as much as 2,133 Mbps, and reduced power consumption to 1.5V.</li>
<li><strong>DDR4-SDRAM</strong>: DDR, 4th generation (DDR4) SDRAM is the current evolution of the DDR technology. The main improvements of DDR4 over DDR3 are double the memory upper limit (up to 16 GB), a data rate of up to 3,200 Mbps, and uses less power (1.2V).</li>
</ul>

<p>The packaging for the RAM modules installed on home and desktop computers is in the form of a slot-mounted IC board with an edge connector with varying amounts of memory (in megabytes) and numbers of contacts (pins). Since the development of the DDR specification, memory boards have been in the form of <strong>dual in-line memory modules</strong> (<strong>DIMMs</strong>), <strong>small outline dual in-line memory modules</strong> (<strong>SO-DIMMs</strong>), and MicroDIMMs:</p>

Pin counts on different DIMM boards</div>
<p>However, in addition to the latest processors, manufacturers have also released new versions of DIMMs. Two of the newer DIMM versions are the RDIMM and the LRDIMM. An RDIMM register buffers between the memory controller and the DRAM on the DIMM. This allows a server to host more RDIMMs, but it can also increase power consumption and additional latency. An LRDIMM uses a memory buffer to combine the electrical signals of its DRAM into a single signal, which allows the DIMM to host up to eight DRAM units. However, the increase in power usage and latency is even higher than that of the RDIMM:</p>

<p>The general rule of thumb in RAM is <em>lower is better</em>, but <em>lower what?</em> Memory doesn't exactly operate in the way we often describe it. What we believe is that an operation involves a request for data from the CPU, the memory controller locating it, and sending the requested data upward. A simple three-step process, <em>right?</em> Well, no. The process involved for the CPU to request data or instructions from memory is more involved than that. In any case, the less time it takes for a memory I/O request to take place, the faster the overall speed of the computer will be.</p>
<p>When you shop for server memory, you may notice a set of numeric values that looks something like this: <kbd>9-10-11-24</kbd>. In the acronyms for these measurements, the lowercase <strong>t</strong> in <strong>tRCD</strong>, <strong>tRP</strong>, and <strong>tRAS</strong> stands for <em>time</em>. This string of numbers represents the four primary measurements in the memory timings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CAS latency (CL)</strong>: The first number in the memory timings represents the <strong>column address strobe</strong> (<strong>CAS</strong>) latency or <strong>CL</strong>, which is the amount of time, in <strong>nanoseconds</strong> (<strong>ns</strong>), it takes to receive and fulfill a request for data.<br/>
The following table shows examples of CL for different memory technologies. Notice that the actual latency is a function of clock cycles multiplied by the CL.</li>

Examples of CL in various memory technologies</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAS to CAS delay (tRCD)</strong>: The arrangement of data in memory is something like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. The second number in the memory timings is the <strong>row address strobe</strong> (<strong>RAS</strong>), which is the time required to locate the row on which requested data is located. The <strong>column address strobe</strong> (<strong>CAS</strong>) then represents the time to move to the corresponding column. In other words, if the requested data is in location C15, RAS is the time to move to row 15 and CAS is the time required to move to column C and the data at C15.</li>
<li><strong>RAS precharge (tRP)</strong>: Although it may sound like almost the opposite of its function, the RAS precharge releases the active row in memory and the tRP, the third value in the memory timings, is the time required to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Row active time (tRAS)</strong>: Also known as <strong>Active to Precharge Delay</strong>, the fourth value, tRAS, is the time required to close an active row and to open a new row. You may also see tRAS described as the time required to complete an instruction and request and receive the next one.</li>

<p>ECC memory is common in computers that process high-value or confidential data, such as computers supporting one or more servers. What differentiates ECC memory from non-ECC memory is that ECC memory modules include a dedicated memory unit that provides parity and error-correction to the other memory units of the module. ECC memory provides assurance of data integrity. Before ECC technology, the method used for error-correction was parity, either even or odd. Non-ECC memory has no error-correcting capability and acts only to fulfill requests from the processor.</p>

<p>You may have heard about the need for memory pairing. You've heard about color coding memory slots. It seems important, but <em>what does either or both have to do with upgrading memory in a server?</em></p>
<p>Many newer motherboards have color-coded dual channel RAM slots. When these slots contain matching memory modules, the system is able to move data to and from both memory boards simultaneously, which reduces the access time. Realistically though, matched memory that facilitates dual-channel mode does improve access time. The improvement isn't that significant over single-channel mode and unmatched memory pairs. However, performance is faster when you install matched memory pairs.</p>

<p>Although there may be differences in the specific colors of the memory slots a manufacturer places on a motherboard, the basic rule of thumb is that memory slots are color-matched in pairs, threes, fours, or whatever the future holds, based on the memory channel technology of the motherboard. For example, in dual channel mode, paired memory slots will both be yellow, orange, or red to indicate the slots for a matching RAM pair.</p>
<p>The same holds true for the threes and fours, and so on:</p>

<p>The components on the motherboard of a computer, as well as the devices connected to it, pass data and instructions to each other constantly. Just like any other form of communication, there must be a medium connecting them. This medium, in this case a <em>bus channel</em>, provides a pathway on which data, addresses, and commands travel.</p>
<p>In a computer, there are two general categories of bus channels: internal bus and external bus. The <em>internal bus</em> is solely on the motherboard and it's used by the motherboard's components to pass data and instructions. The <em>external bus</em> provides a means for peripherals and expansion components to communicate with the components on the motherboard.</p>
<p>The term <em>bus</em> comes from the Latin word <em>omnibus</em>, which translates to <em>for everyone</em>. The connecting links in a computer carry <em>everything</em>, so they became buses. Bus shouldn't be confused with <em>buss</em>, which is another way to say kiss.</p>
<p>A bus structure consists of three coordinating bus lines (see the diagram in the following <em>Bus width</em> section):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control bus</strong>: The CPU transmits commands and instructions to a component or device to which it needs to send or from which it needs to receive, data or perform a command. This is a dedicated one-way bus that carries the command needed on the contents located at the address on the address bus.</li>
<li><strong>Address bus</strong>: The CPU transmits the address of data requiring a service to a component or device. The address bus is also a one-way bus.</li>
<li><strong>Data bus</strong>: The CPU sends or receives data from memory or a device controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>A bus channel consists of a number of wire traces, each of which carries a signal (bit) to a device pin. Bus channel's traces are typically in multiples of eight, as in 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, and so on, with the number of traces controlling the amount of memory possible on the system. The number of bits or traces in a bus channel limits the high-end address value. For example, an 8-bit address bus can only address memory cells up to 28 or 256. If the bus has 32 bits, the highest address in memory that it can reference is 232 or 4,294,967,296 (a bit over 4 GB or 500 MB). Obviously, the wider a bus channel is (that is, the more bits wide), the higher the number that it can represent in binary.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The descriptions and specifications of a microprocessor include the bus width with which it's compatible. For example, the Intel Xeon and the AMD Athlon are popular server CPUs, and both are 64-bit processors:</p>

<p>Not every motherboard comes complete with your favorite peripherals, controllers, or interfaces, in fact, few ever will. To help you get over this, motherboards include a few expansion slots into which you can insert the interface cards for the devices and functions you need. Over the years of computing and servers, a number of expansion card standards have come and gone, with new standards or extended standards taking their place. The <em>Color-coded RAM slots</em> section, earlier in the chapter, showed a motherboard that had two sets of expansion card slots (blue and white).</p>
<p>For the Server+ exam, the list of bus channel and expansion slot technologies you need to know in detail is short and from the same family: PCI—also known as <strong>PCI conventional</strong>, <strong>PCI-extended</strong> (<strong>PCI-X</strong>), and <strong>PCI-Express</strong> (<strong>PCI-e</strong>). The PCI slots and expansion cards of these standards differ in a number of areas, but the most significant differences are in their slot and card heights and lengths, bus width, and signal voltage.</p>

<p>All PCI and their variations apply the same physical board format standard. The standards for PCI boards specify four size and fit formats: full-height, low-profile, full-length, and half-length. There are a few exceptions though:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full-height expansion card won't fit a low-profile slot</li>
<li>A half-height expansion card will fit a full-length slot</li>
<li>A half-height expansion card won't fit a full-height slot</li>
<li>A full-length expansion card won't fit a half-length slot</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so the last one's a no-brainer! The best practice is to match PCI expansion cards to their corresponding PCI slots.</p>

<p>The <em>bus width</em> of a bus channel is the number of traces in the channel. In general, the PCI bus and its variations, the bus width is either 32 or 64 traces. At the risk of being repetitive, a trace in a bus channel carries one bit of the data transmitted on the bus. The <em>signal voltage</em> of the PCI standard is one of either 5V or 3.3V.</p>
<p>The more common variations of the PCI conventional standard (see the following diagram) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>32-bit PCI—5V signal voltage</strong>: This is a common PCI slot on desktop computer motherboards. Its clock speed is 33 MHz and its DTR is a maximum of 1 Gbps.</li>
<li><strong>64-bit PCI—5V signal voltage</strong>: This is typically a server and dual processor motherboard expansion slot with a clock speed of 33 MHz and a maximum DTR of 2.1 Gbps.</li>

<p>The PCI-e bus standard replaces the <span>conventional </span>PCI and the PCI-X bus standards. The main difference between PCI-e and PCI is bus topology (signal format). The PCI-e bus uses a point-to-point serial communication channel and PCI uses a shared parallel bus. Another difference is that PCI's bus is only as fast as the slowest device attached and PCI-e supports full-duplex communications between any end point devices:</p>

<p>Most newer motherboards incorporate all or some of the functions of NICs, <span>also known a</span>s <strong>network adapters</strong>, into their chipsets. This is especially true for wireless communication. Many active network servers connect to network or communication links through one or more network adapters installed as expansion cards.</p>
<p>The primary function of an NIC is to provide a connection and interface between its host computer and a network. The NIC converts the data sent by the computer into a format compatible with the network's protocols and standards.</p>

<p>An HBA provides a connecting point for peripheral devices to a computer. An HBA is usually an expansion card inserted into a slot on a motherboard. The HBA card serves as a conduit through which an external device and a computer can communicate. Perhaps the most common HBA installed in servers is a hard disk controller card, which includes a disk controller and provides an interface to one or more hard disk drives. The hard disk interfaces provided by an HBA include Ethernet, <strong>Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment</strong> (<strong>PATA</strong>)/<strong>Integrated Drive Electronics</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>), <strong>Serial Advanced Technology Attachment</strong> (<strong>SATA</strong>), and <strong>Small Computer System Interface</strong> (<strong>SCSI</strong>) devices, among others.</p>

<p>Another type of HBA is a RAID controlle<em>r</em>, <span>also known as a</span> <em>disk array controller</em>. A disk array controller provides management of multiple hard disk drives, which it presents to a CPU as logical, rather than physical, units. The RAID technology in use must be the same for the RAID controller and the disk drives. For example, a <strong>RAID O</strong> controller won't work with any RAID technology involving fault tolerance.</p>

<p>A riser card is a board that plugs into the system board and provides additional slots for adapter cards. Because it rises above the system board, it enables you to connect additional adapters to the system in an orientation that is parallel to the system board and saves space within the system case. Riser boards are common to rack-mounted servers. One rack-unit, 1U systems can have a single-slot riser integrated into the motherboard, which allows an expansion card to fit inside the case. A 2U computer may have an integrated riser like a 1U or an expansion slot for a 3.5-inch riser card with three slots. The following image shows an example of a 2U riser card with two PCI-e 8x ports:</p>

<p>There are several USB standards, each with its own size, shape, and purpose. All USB standards define a communication protocol, a physical cable, and one or more sets of connectors and ports. The shape and size of each USB connector and port, regardless of its version, is one of several connector types. Some of the standards are functionally compatible as long as the connector and port used are of the same type.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The different USB connector types, at least those still in use, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type A</strong>: Type A connectors and ports are what most people think of as a USB. This connector type is on <span>virtually every computer, regardless of its portability. It's also found on many game consoles, television sets, audio devices, and so on. A-type connections provide a down-link between a peripheral device and a host with the host supplying 5V DC power to the connected device.</span></li>
<li><strong>Type B</strong>: Type B connectors and ports are common to the device end of the cables for printers, external disk drives, and other peripherals.</li>
<li><strong>Type C</strong>: USB Type C connectors and ports haven't found a purpose on a network server, yet. Type C has become common for cellular telephones, notebooks, and other portable devices. Its benefits are that a Type C connector isn't oriented (there is no up or down) and either end of a cable can connect to a host system:</li>

<p>An extremely important part of the administration of any server is its configuration settings. Remember that a computer is just a bunch of electrical and electronic components interconnected to accomplish a task <span>repetitively</span>, over and over. The configuration settings for a server are initially set in its firmware when the motherboard and its <strong>read-only memory</strong> (<strong>ROM</strong>) are manufactured. However, at some point in the life of any server, something in its configuration settings will change. New peripherals, storage devices, memory size, or other additions or adjustments are likely to keep the server supporting the needs of the network.</p>

<p>BIOS has been with us since 1975 and basically hasn't changed much functionally over the years. BIOS resides on non-volatile memory (ROM) on a computer's motherboard and is 1) the first instruction set executed when a computer powers on and 2) provides operational support to the operating system for input and output operations.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the BIOS is to provide the information needed to initialize the system, load the device drives for all connected storage devices and peripherals, and to load and initiate the operating system. The configuration data used by the boot process is in a small amount of memory on a CMOS chip. To ensure that the configuration settings are always available for the system startup process, a coin-style flat cell battery, called the CMOS battery, which has a service life of about 10 years, is used.</p>
<p>BIOS reads the first sector on the primary hard disk drive to access the address of the boot device (typically a hard disk drive) or the address of the initialization instructions (code). It then initializes the boot device and starts the operating system. BIOS has one big limitation, though—it only supports 16-bit data transfer, which restricts the amount of data read from ROM.</p>

<p>Many newer computers used as servers now have a UEFI in place of BIOS and some systems even have both. UEFI is a system configuration technology developed to replace BIOS. While UEFI and BIOS essentially perform the same basic functions, UEFI stores its configuration data in a <kbd>.EFI</kbd> file on a hard disk drive in a special area called the <strong>EFI System Partition</strong> (<strong>ESP</strong>). The files needed to load and initialize the operating system are also in the ESP.</p>

<p>A CPU is the electronic component that runs programs, performs arithmetic functions, and manages data and the input and output functions of a computer. A multiprocessor is a single computer with two or more CPUs, either symmetrical or asymmetrical. In SMP, CPUs are equal and share resources, but in ASMP, one CPU is a master and all other CPUs are slaves. Multiprocessing computers support SIMD, MISD, and MIMD. Multi-core processing involves a single microprocessor that contains multiple processors or cores.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Computer systems use several types of cache memory, including browser cache, disk cache, memory cache, and processor cache. Cache memory provides data to a CPU faster than from main memory. CPU systems include three levels of cache memory: L3, L2, and L1.</p>
<p>CPU speed, measured in MHz, is a function of FSB. The CPU's internal frequency applies the CPU multiplier to the FSB's frequency. Stepping is the application of revisions to a CPU. DRAM is volatile; SRAM is non-volatile but loses its stored contents when no system power is available. Memory timing measurements include CL, tRCD, tRP, and tRAS. ECC memory has a dedicated memory unit that provides parity and error-correction.</p>
<p>The bus channels are the internal bus and external bus. The internal bus is on the motherboard and passes data and instructions between its components. The external bus provides peripherals and expansion cards with a communications link. Bus structures include the control bus, address bus, and data bus. The bus channels and expansion slots you should know about are PCI, PCI-X, and PCI-e, and their significant differences.</p>
<p>BIOS is permanently on ROM and contains the first instructions executed when a computer powers on. BIOS boots the system, loads device drives, and initiates the OS. Configuration data for the boot process is on CMOS. Newer computers have UEFI in place of BIOS.</p>
