Created as an educational tool to inspire the next generation of programmers, the Raspberry Pi is also an excellent network server. It can be used to share files, host websites, create Internet access points, and analyze network traffic. Multiple Raspberry Pis can be clustered to create a single, highly available, and fault-tolerant super computer. This book shows you how.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation recognized that <span class="emphasis"><em>computers had become so expensive and arcane that programming experimentation on them had to be forbidden by parents</em></span>. The parental restrictions on using computers had created a <span class="emphasis"><em>year-on-year decline in the numbers and skills levels of the A Level students applying to read Computer Science</em></span>. So, the Foundation set out to create a computer that was "affordable, and powerful enough to provide excellent multimedia, a feature we felt would make the board desirable to kids who wouldn't initially be interested in a purely programming-oriented device".</p><p>2 million Raspberry Pis were sold in the first two years of its release, which was not limited to educators and school children. Hobbyists were also excited to use the inexpensive Linux-based computer in their projects. In February 2015, the quad-core Raspberry Pi 2 was released with significantly more power and memory than the original, which was more than enough memory and power for many typical server applications.</p><p>In this cookbook, you'll find a collection of server-side recipes for the Raspberry Pi, including recipes to set up file servers and web servers, create secure wireless access points, and analyze network traffic. There is even a recipe to create a highly available fault-tolerant supercomputer.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/><span class="strong"><strong>What this book covers</strong></span></h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Installation and Setup">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Installation and Setup</em></span>, has a number of beginner recipes to set up the Raspberry Pi as a network server, which include instructions on how to download and install new operating system images, boot for the first time, and the proper way to shut down the system.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Administration">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Administration</em></span>, has more beginner recipes to configure the Raspberry Pi as a network server, which includes instructions on how to execute privileged commands, configure remote access, and manage user accounts.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Maintenance">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Maintenance</em></span>, has intermediate and advanced recipes to maintain the Raspberry Pi server.

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>For most of the recipes in this book, you will need a little more than a basic Raspberry Pi setup (Raspberry Pi and a power supply) that is connected to a local area network.</p><p>You may choose to use a display, keyboard, and a mouse with the Raspberry Pi. However, most recipes have been written to remotely access the Raspberry Pi as a server.</p><p>Internet access is required to download software and connect to the Internet of Things.</p></div>
