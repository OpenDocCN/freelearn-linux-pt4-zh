    talk about it, is hardware first and software second. While it's easier to envision
    a computer as a network server, in fact, the server is a piece of software running
    on the computer. In its most strict definition, a server is anything that provides
    services to fulfill requests made to it. Therefore, someone who takes our order
    and brings us our meal in a restaurant is a server and, in the same way, software
    running on a computer that processes an SQL request on a database and returns
    the data to the requester is also a server. Regardless of the way you envision
    a server, for the sake of learning about servers, let's agree that a centralized
    computer running server software that provides services to a network is a server.

    processing and retrieval of the requested data. The database server then returns
    the data back to the requesting node. In a database client/server environment,
    the database management system, which performs the input/output operations on
    the database, is the backend. The software running on a host computer or an application
    server is the frontend. Requests for data flow from the frontend to the backend

    a resource is located, used, and administered. Without directory services, network
    resource addressing would be like a town in which the houses don't have street
    addresses. Efficient network operations would be impossible. Directory services
    are also known as name services because they manage a namespace. A **namespace**
    is a data abstraction that holds a list of names or identities of system resources,
    in this case, and their network addresses or locations. The namespace allows users,
    applications, and other services to access resources without the need to know
    their locations in advance. A directory server, or name server, is a server application
    that provides the organization, management, and security of the directory or name
    services, for example, Microsoft Active Directory, Red Hat Directory Server, Lotus

    minus (negative) polarities, which yields one *live* side and one *ground* side.
    The 110V and 230V systems connect the grounding connection to the negative (minus)
    side. Negative 48V power connects its ground to the positive (plus) side. In case
    you're wondering why telecom systems use a negative voltage standard, it's because

    server's PSU needs to be more robust and operationally efficient than a standard
    PSU included in a typical desktop or portable computer. Because servers are essential

- en: All electronic devices produce heat. Some do so more than others, and cooling
    must reduce the heat effect to avoid failure or intermittent problems. The electronic
    components found inside a server (mostly on the motherboard) that produce significant
    heat include microprocessors, **graphics processing units** (**GPUs**), chipsets,
    RAM, and **voltage regulator modules** (**VRMs**). Of these, microprocessors (CPUs)
    and GPUs produce most of the heat inside a server. High heat conditions or a condition
    called **thermal stress** can affect the service life or operations of electronic
    components. Physics tells us that when things get hot, they expand, and when they
    cool off, they contract. Any electronic component that continuously goes through
    heat and cool cycles, meaning expansion and contraction, is stressed, which can
    lead to performance issues. The bigger the difference between how hot hot is and
    how cool cool is relates directly to the severity of the damage done. Most newer
    computer systems and processors now carry a rating called **thermal design power**
    (**TDP**), which represents the amount of heat produced by the system or unit.
    The following table lists a few examples of the maximum TDP rating of several
    processors. This value indicates the amount of heat the cooling system must dissipate
    to keep the system running as it should. Although there are no standards for interpreting
    TDP, a lower value indicates the power usage and the heat produced is lower. TDP
    is only a general indicator of a system's cooling needs.

    system. In desktops, towers, and some laptops, the cooling system is inside the
    case. For a blade server, the cooling may be in the blade cabinet, the rack cabinet,
    or in the computer room overall. Several different methods are available to cool
    the internal components of a computer system. Some of these systems are legacy
    and some are new. For the Server+ exam, you should understand the cooling systems

- en: A basic air-cooling system is typically a default system built into a computer's
    case and internal components. In its simplest form, an air-cooling system consists
    of a **heat sink**, **thermal paste**, and the computer's **case fan**. A heat
    sink attaches directly to a CPU with a small amount of thermal paste between the
    two to provide a thermal conductor. Air gaps between the heat sink and the CPU
    can act as thermal insulators, so the thermal paste eliminates this possibility.
    The heat sink is a ribbed metal extrusion that extends the surface of the CPU
    to allow more air to dissipate the heat. Air flow from one or more case fans moves
    across the fins of the heat sink to carry the heat away. This type of heat dissipation
    is known as **passive cooling**. Adding baffles, or air flow defectors, to passive
    cooling systems to specifically direct the air flow can enhance the effectiveness
    of the air-cooling system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some upper-end cases include not only multiple fans (two or more case fans and
    a graphics card fan), but a baffle system that directs the airflow to the CPU
    and other hots spots in the case. The alternative to cooling a computer with air
    flow is **liquid cooling**, which uses a coolant to pull the heat away from the
    CPU. Liquid cooling applies the thermodynamic principle that heat from a warm
    object will move to a cooler object. A CPU liquid cooling system works like the
    cooling system in an automobile. A liquid coolant, in this case distilled water,
    is pumped through an attachment on the CPU. The coolness of the water draws the
    heat of the CPU away and dissipates in the air flow.

- en: 'In this chapter, you learned that the software running on a computer establishes
    its role as the server. A server can provide a variety of services to a network''s
    clients, including: application servers, file servers, mail servers, messaging
    servers, network servers, print servers, RRAS, and web servers. The different
    types of application servers are LAN application servers: query-based application
    servers, and application/web servers. A file server is either dedicated or non-dedicated.
    Network services servers provide core services on the OSI application layer. Although
    the NOS provides many network services and protocols, services such as the DNS,
    DHCP, IM, VoIP, and NTP may come from a network services server. Proxy servers
    are intermediate network servers that accept, fulfill, filter, and forward requests
    from remote clients. The types of proxy servers are: gateway, internet-facing,
    open, internal-facing, and reverse. Two other server types that you may encounter
    on the Server+ exam are RRAS, which is a type of network services server that
    provides firewall, router, and remote access services, and a virtual server that
    is a software-enabled logic object operating in the memory of a physical computer.
    Servers and computers, in general, conform to a particular form factor standard.
    A form factor designates the dimensions, shape, physical characteristics, and
    power and cooling performance of a computer case along, with the power supply,
    motherboard, RAM, and other components installed inside the system case.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The form factor standard for servers is ATX. Tower computers have a standing
    case or cabinet, as do desktop and notebook designs. Rack-mountable servers are
    commonly 1U or 2U in height with their width matching the width of the rack or
    cabinet. A blade server enclosure is a cabinet of sorts that houses server blades,
    each of which is a server itself. A PSU converts domestic AC or DC (110V or 230V)
    into +3.3VDC, +5VDC, and +/- 12VDC and telecommunication devices use -48V power.
    Factors for consideration when selecting a PSU for a server include wattage, connectors
    and modularity, efficiency rating, rails, external connection, and voltage switching.
    Redundant power supplies have two or more PSUs that can provide power in combination,
    alternatively, or with actives and standbys. The components inside a server, especially
    CPUs, GPUs, chipsets, RAM, and VRMs, produce heat that can cause thermal stress
    on some components. Thermal stress can, and usually does, affect electronic components.
