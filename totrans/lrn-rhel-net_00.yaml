- en: Welcome to *Learning RHEL Networking*. My name is *Andrew Mallett* and I will
    offer you expert guidance and tuition that will provide you with the skills to
    tame this powerful and popular Linux distribution. We will work with Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux 7.1\. This latest release offers many improvements and is more likely to
    be the next version. The movement to the new system, the service management of
    systemd and the ecosystem that spawns from it offers so much new for administrators
    to absorb.

    in the number of organizations deploying Linux. As a result, we require knowledgeable
    professionals to manage these systems. The Linux Foundation with Dice, a specialist
    recruitment company, surveyed many large organizations and found the following
    results:'

- en: Enterprise Linux distributions, such as CentOS, Red Hat, Debian, and SUSE Enterprise
    Linux, do not deploy the latest and greatest bleeding-edge technology that you
    may find on home or enthusiast-oriented distributions, such as Fedora or openSUSE.
    Rather, they allow these to be development platforms to hone and perfect the software
    before migrating it to an enterprise a few months or even years later. Enterprise
    Linux has to be dependable, reliable, resilient, and supportable by the organization
    deploying it and the backend support coming from the community or paid support
    teams. By definition, the latest in software development does not lend itself
    well to this; these are the latest development, and knowledge of these developments
    and best practices will take time to evolve and develop.

    Linux differs from other bleeding-edge distributions and the relationship between
    Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora. This short chapter gives you a great understanding
    of RHEL and helps you learn RHEL 7 on your choice of platform.'

    configure NTP, DNS, DHCP, and SMTP, time, name resolution, IP address assignment,

    to implement network-based storage. This chapter teaches you how to deploy iSCSI
    targets and connect from an RHEL client.'

    *File Sharing with NFS*, explains NFS, a de facto Unix file sharing service, which
    still maintains its importance in the Enterprise Linux market. This chapter covers
    how to use NFSv4 and compares it with V3 so that you can appreciate its easier
    firewall management feature among many other new features.'

    with Samba 4"), *Implementing Windows Shares with Samba 4*, covers instances where
    RHEL can provide services on a network and the client-side workstation will have
    Windows OS installed at their end. This requires RHEL to support these Windows
    clients. File and print services can be supplied through the Samba 4 service on
    RHEL 7.'

    Active Directory Domains"), *Integrating RHEL 7 into Microsoft Active Directory
    Domains*, explores the fact that many enterprise organizations have already set
    up Identity Services and are run with Microsoft''s Active Directory. It makes
    sense that these existing domain accounts should be used to access resources on
    the RHEL 7 server. The RHEL server can join the domain server and become a member
    server that allows you to share single sign-on to shared resources hosted on the
    Linux system.'

    important for your network. This may be to provision web access to an intranet
    or external access to the Internet. Many administrators use the Apache web server
    to provide access to local software repositories and install sources, so the importance
    of this service cannot be overlooked.'

    with more and more systems connecting to the Internet, the vulnerability of your
    network facing services is increasing exponentially. SELinux has been included
    on RHEL since release 4, but very often, we read blogs that suggest that SELinux
    should be disabled. This chapter teaches you how to deploy systems with SELinux
    effectively.'
