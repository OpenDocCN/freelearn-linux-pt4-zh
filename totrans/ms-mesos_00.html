<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively. It improves resource utilization, simplifies system administration, and supports a wide variety of distributed applications that can be effortlessly deployed leveraging its pluggable architecture.</p><p>This book will provide a detailed step-by-step guide to deploying a Mesos cluster using all the standard DevOps tools to port Mesos frameworks effectively and in general demystify the concept of Mesos.</p><p>The book will first establish the raison d'être of Mesos and explain its architecture in an effective manner. From there, the book will walk the reader through the complex world of Mesos, moving progressively from simple single machine setups to highly complex multi-node cluster setups with new concepts logically introduced along the way. At the end of the journey, the reader will be armed with all the resources
that he/she requires to effectively manage the complexities of today's modern datacenter requirements.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

It also discusses the two-level scheduling approach that Mesos employs, provides a detailed overview of its API, and provides a few examples of how Mesos is used in production.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Mesos Internals">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mesos Internals</em></span>, provides a comprehensive overview of Mesos' features and walks the reader through several important topics regarding high availability, fault tolerance, scaling, and efficiency, such as resource allocation, resource reservation, and recovery, among others.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Getting Started with Mesos">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Mesos</em></span>, covers how to manually set up and run a Mesos
cluster on the public cloud (AWS, GCE, and Azure) as well as on a private datacentre (on premise). It also discuss the various debugging methods and explores how to
troubleshoot the Mesos setup in detail.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Service Scheduling and Management Frameworks">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Service Scheduling and Management Frameworks</em></span>, introduces several Mesos-based scheduling and management frameworks or applications that are required for the easy deployment, discovery, load balancing, and failure handling of long-running services.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Mesos Cluster Deployment">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mesos Cluster Deployment</em></span>, explains how a Mesos cluster can be easily set up and monitored using the standard deployment and configuration management tools used by system administrators and DevOps engineers. It also
discusses some of the common problems faced while deploying a Mesos cluster along with their corresponding resolutions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Mesos Frameworks">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mesos Frameworks</em></span>, walks the reader through the concept and features of Mesos frameworks in detail.
