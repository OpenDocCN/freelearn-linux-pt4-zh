<p class="mce-root"><span>Virtually every business and organization has come to rely on a computer network for its information, analysis, application, and media, as well as email, web access, scheduling, and personal productivity applications. In most cases, the network has become integrated into the fabric of these organizations with its availability taken for granted. However, when a technical problem causes the network to go down, network administrators must identify the problem, resolve it, and assure its integrity—all in as little time as possible.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we look at a number of common network problems, their causes, and some of the <strong>Network Operating System</strong> (<strong>NOS</strong>) utilities and tools that are commonly used as part of the troubleshooting process. The specific topics that will be introduced are as follows:</p>

<p>The list of common network problems is likely to vary from organization to organization. The common issues of any organization are a function of several variables, such as budget, staffing, training, and environment. The common network problems listed in the following sections are those identified in the Server+ objectives as being on the certification exam.</p>

<p>In some working environments, the loss of an internet connection may not be much of a problem, particularly if the activity on the network is local and doesn't need to go out onto the <span><strong>Wide Area Network</strong> (</span><strong>WAN</strong>). However, at some point, access to the internetwork beyond the organization's gateway router becomes necessary, and users expect the service to be available.</p>
<p>The communication link between a <strong>Local Area Network</strong> (<strong>LAN</strong>) and a WAN includes several components, each of which could cause the link to fail. The following list includes the major pieces of this link and the potential for it to be the cause of a lost connection to the internet. Of course, you'd check these potential causes after you've checked the electrical cord and plug:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cables</strong>: On a wired network, a loose connection or a faulty connector will typically cause connectivity problems.</li>
<li><strong>Connections</strong><span>:</span> On a wireless network, the host may not be able to connect to the access point or router and, if it can, it should be able to see the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Network Interface Controller </strong>(<strong>NIC</strong>) <strong>failure</strong><span>:</span> If the host has an <strong>Automatic Private IP Addressing</strong> (<strong>APIPA</strong>) address, the next thing to check is the NIC or network adapter to see whether it's working. Perhaps the easiest way to check its status is in the Windows Device Manager. As shown in the following screenshot, opening <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span> of the network adapter provides its functional status. If it is not working, the next step is to determine why:</li>
</ul>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Device Manager and the Properties box of a network adapter</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gateway configuration</strong>: If the host can't see the gateway device, but you know the gateway has power and should be working, there is a possibility that the gateway configuration has become altered, corrupted, or hacked.</li>
<li><strong>Service availability</strong><span>:</span> Regardless of the type of internet service you subscribe to, if the host is able to connect to the gateway device, but cannot connect to the internet, the problem could be that the device is faulty or the problem lies with the service provider. If the subscriber side of a connection is working without any faults, this could mean that the ISP's service is down. We'll go over more of the network status-checking commands later in this chapter.</li>

<p>A common problem with network performance and connectivity is the configuration of the various components, both hardware and software. The configuration of the NOS, the host and its operating system, the network adapters in all the networking devices, and the interconnecting switching and routing devices must be compatible and configured to be in line with the purpose and function of the network.</p>
<p>The following sections are the common configuration issues that can be found on a network.</p>

<p>One common cause for internet, and even some intranet, addressing problems is an improperly configured DHCP server. Another common related problem is the <strong>Domain Name System</strong> (<strong>DNS</strong>), but more on this later. It's absolutely possible to boot up a network host without it receiving its IP configuration from the DHCP server. If the host's user never tries to access any resources outside of the host, no problems will typically appear. However, without a valid IP configuration, the host is very limited in terms of what it can reach.</p>
<p>There are two common reasons for a host failing to receive its IP configuration: no network connectivity and DHCP server issues. <a href="2c3ab014-0f7a-4383-919a-3b10463a5937.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Common Hardware Issues,</em> dealt with the issues of the NIC, but let's take a look at DHCP server problems.</p>

<p>One problem can be if a Windows host has a network connection, but, after booting up, it's configured with an unusual APIPA default address. This address is from a reserved Class B address group of <kbd>169.254.0.0/16</kbd>. The purpose of the APIPA configuration is to allow the booking process and IP configuration to complete, so the host can operate on the local network. Routers don't forward APIPA addresses, but the resources of the local network should be available. However, this access is dependent on the configuration of any switches on the LAN.</p>
<p>After assigning the default IP address, the APIPA service checks for the presence of a DHCP server <span>approximately every five minutes</span>. When the DHCP server is online once again, it replaces the APIPA configuration with the DHCP configuration.</p>

<p>The most common issues with the configuration of a DHCP server are the issuance of duplicated IP address configurations, an exhausted address pool, and misconfigured static address assignments.</p>
<p>The issue of the same IP address being given to two or more hosts can happen when multiple devices (such as the router, switch, or network server) have an enabled DHCP server function using an overlapping range of addresses (called the <strong>scope</strong>), which duplicate static addresses that have been previously assigned to hosts.</p>
<p>An exhausted (or emptied) address pool means that the next host requesting a configuration will configure itself with an APIPA address.</p>
<p>DHCP servers assign an IP address and its related configuration to a network host in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic</strong>: This form of allocation designates an IP address to a host permanently, meaning an <em>unlimited</em> lease period.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong><span>:</span> In this allocation option, the DHCP server assigns an IP address from a predefined address scope for a preset lease period. This option allows for renewals.</li>
<li><strong>Static</strong><span>:</span> A specific IP address assigned to a host. A static IP address is a reserved address and is permanently linked to the host's MAC address.</li>
</ul>

<p>If one or more components of a server or a network are misconfigured, it can have no effect at all. Alternatively, it can bring the system down and, as is commonly the case, without any real clue as to why. On the Server+ certification exam, you may encounter questions concerning the potential impact of several misconfigured devices, services, and protocols.</p>
<p>The following sections cover the issues you may see.</p>

<p>For the most part, email problems typically result from misconfiguration. An email system typically involves a server, a transport mechanism (or protocol), and a client, all of which must work together. Some common problems that an email system may have include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The client is unable to send or receive messages</strong><span>:</span> If your localhost is able to connect to the internet, the problem is likely to be with the mail system and commonly in the data entered to identify a mailbox identity (such as the email address and password).<br/>
In Microsoft Office, the account information of the Outlook client is common for all installed Office software. However, if Outlook is unable to download mail from the server, the <span class="packt_screen">Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365</span> tool may be able to identify the problem, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129 image-border" src="Images/ded344b0-1fdc-4f58-88a8-fe3c7189d3e6.jpg" style="width:66.67em;height:42.83em;" width="800" height="514"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant can scan Outlook for email errors</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Linux and Windows systems may also use a shareware or freeware mail client, such as Thunderbird (Mozilla), KMail, Evolution, or Geary. The configuration is straightforward and typically requires only an email address and a password, as shown in the upcoming screenshot.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The client can receive emails but is unable to send emails</strong><span>:</span> This situation normally means that the client may be trying to forward an email to TCP/UDP port <kbd>25</kbd>. This well-known port was, at one time, the default port in nearly all email clients for outbound email. However, since spammers access port <kbd>25</kbd> routinely, most mail servers now block that port and use port <kbd>587</kbd> instead. Check the port assigned to the send mail function.</li>
<li><strong>The client can send emails but is unable to receive emails</strong><span>: T</span>his problem results from one or both of two conditions. Mail servers, especially those that support the <strong>Internet Message Access Protocol</strong> (<strong>IMAP</strong>), operate within a set amount of allocated storage space for storing copies of forwarded messages. If the storage allocation fills up, email forwarding stops. The remedy for this is to access the mail server and delete any unneeded messages. The other condition is the configuration of the inbound account. Make sure that the incoming mail server, port number, email account, and password are all correct. Send yourself an email to check it<span>:</span></li>

<p>On a Windows system, the <kbd>hosts</kbd> file provides a localhost DNS-type of lookup to provide the IP address of a <strong>F</strong><span><strong>ully Qualified Domain Name</strong> (<strong>FQDN</strong>)</span><span>. As illustrated in the following screenshot,</span> the <kbd>hosts</kbd> file <span>shows a domain name and its corresponding IP address. This entry eliminates the need to communicate with a DNS server to obtain the IP address.

<p>Although NIC cards, USB drives, and built-in network adapters rarely do so, they can fail. However, if you suspect the network card or adapter of interrupting communications to and from the network, typically the issue is one of two problems—either the NIC card or adapter is bad, or the NIC card or adapter is not getting the system resources it needs to do its job.</p>
<p>In most cases, at least with NICs, there are LED to help you identify whether it's working properly. When the system is powered up and connected to the network, if you don't see any green lights, you've found your problem. Still, the NIC may not be so bad that it requires replacing. It may be that it was reinstalled incorrectly, or a jumper block or switch setting may be incorrect. Check your documentation for these possibilities. Another issue involves the NIC card or the adapter with the same system resources as another I/O device. On a Windows system, Device Manager can help to identify any resource assignment issues, as you can see in the following screenshot. Device Manager can also check for a network adapter on the motherboard. Make sure in either case that the correct and up-to-date device drivers are in use:</p>

<p>Above all else, misconfigured routers and switches (as well as firewalls) are security issues. These devices can start out correctly configured to service and protect its network and interact with external networks. However, changes to a network, misinformation from a service provider, typing errors, and the ever-present <em>while I'm in here, let's see what else I can do</em> syndrome of network administrators can result in misconfiguration.</p>
<p>In addition to security, errors in the configuration of internetworking devices can also cause problems for the devices behind them, such as content servers, proxy servers, and LAN switches. Troubleshooting configuration problems on these devices can be a bit more complicated than on a network server.</p>

<p>Before we get into some of the common issues and problems associated with a <strong>Virtual Local Area Network</strong> (<strong>VLAN</strong>), let's recall some of its terminology. Essentially, a VLAN is a logically created broadcast domain configured on a network switch. By designating one (or more) ports to a VLAN, besides VLAN1, which all ports belong to by default, the stations configured to that port are now on that VLAN.</p>
<p>As shown in the following diagram, dispersed hosts on different physical LAN segments can also be on a single VLAN. Also shown in this diagram, are the links that directly connect the switches and router to one another. These links are known as trunks, and the interface port to which the trunk connects is called a trunk port. Trunk ports run a special protocol, such as the IEEE 802.1Q, or the Cisco <strong>Inter-Switch Link</strong> (<strong>ISL</strong>).</p>
<p>Two common problems of a VLAN typically have to do with IP addresses, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network hosts configured with incorrect IP addresses, such as an APIPA, or an erroneous subnet address or mask, and not being able to access the network, let alone a VLAN</li>
<li>Failing to configure interface ports to support each VLAN as a network segment or subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>Other VLAN issues, beyond IP addresses, include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A VLAN is configured in a <em>down</em> state</li>
<li>The VLAN's terminating trunk ports must be running the same trunking protocol and a common configuration as either a <em>tagged</em> or <em>untagged</em> VLAN</li>
</ul>
<p>Some VLAN issues are the result of problems with a trunk port, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If two trunk ports each has a different trunk mode, they are unable to establish a link.</li>
<li>A VLAN won't function if it's not on the list of authorized VLANs that can access a particular trunk port.</li>
<li>A trunk port begins <em>flapping</em>. This condition is commonly associated with router ports, but switch ports can flap as well. <strong>Flapping</strong> is a hardware failure that causes the port to power on and off alternatively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram shows you the VLAN configuration:</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most common network connection problem. Its causes are less than obvious and none of them is a problem of the gateway router itself. All you know is that you are suddenly unable to access the internet or any site beyond the gateway, and a message says that the default gateway is not available (see the following screenshot). Here are the common causes of this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antivirus or anti-malware software</strong>: This has been known to change the network configuration of a host, including the default gateway's IP address. Remote this program and reset the default gateway configuration by rebooting the computer. If this solves the issue (you may have to wait a while before deciding), there you go.</li>
<li><strong>Outdated network adapter drivers</strong>: This may interfere with communications to the network connection on a computer. Check the default gateway connection after each of the following fixes (stopping after the one that seems to resolve the problem): reinstall the drivers, update the drivers, and replace or add in a network adapter.</li>
<li><strong>Windows auto-login</strong>: This has been known to mess up the IP configuration of a host at startup, including the IP address of the default gateway. There is no way to actually disable the auto-login feature, but you can set the login to require a username and password, which seems to solve the issue:</li>
</ul>

<p>One result from a gateway error, such as the gateway address disappearing from the IP configuration on any operating system, is the message, <em>resource not available or unreachable</em>. The <kbd>route</kbd> command, which is available on virtually all operating systems, displays the content of the route table, which should include the address of the default gateway, as you can see in the following screenshot.

In any case, the purpose and performance of a firewall remains the same: to protect a network, server, or host from intrusion or attack. Like everything else in computing, firewalls can have problems. Here are a few of the firewall problems you might face:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong><strong>onfiguration issues</strong>: If the configuration process of a firewall depends heavily on the default configuration, it's very likely that the resultant configuration will be too broad in scope and not specific enough in terms of detail. It's best to limit the configuration process to the core functions of the organization's security policies as a foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Currency issues</strong>: All too often, a firewall becomes a <em>set it and forget it</em> device, when, in fact, constant monitoring and maintenance to keep it current with its settings, rules, and updates should be normal procedure.</li>
<li><strong>Processing power</strong><span>:</span> Software firewalls can become a bottleneck if installed on a computer with insufficient resources to handle the demand during peak operating hours. One way to lessen the load on the firewall is to limit or remove those features that aren't really necessary for the primary mission of the device or software.</li>
<li><strong>IP address validity</strong><span>:</span> A common hack is to send a message into a local network's firewall that contains a bogus IP address in either the source or destination addresses (or both). If the pass/deny rules defined on the firewall don't consider phony or fictitious IP addresses outside the limits of IP standards, the incoming traffic of messages with dubious addresses could pass through to the internal network.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the preceding, the Server+ objectives list a few other, more generic, hardware or software issues of which you should know the cause and cure. You may not encounter a question dealing specifically with one of these issues, but don't be surprised if they show up as a part of a question's scenario, or as one of its answer choices. Here they are, in no specific order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource unavailable</strong>: This error is very contextual. If it results from a mail client, then it's an email problem; if it results from a virtual machine, then it's a virtual machine problem; if it results from a network access issue, it could be a server or a network device problem. Most users associate this error with HTTP and either the <kbd>404</kbd> or <kbd>503</kbd> error conditions. The common meaning behind this message in any situation is that a requested file, service, or device is unavailable because of a name change, deletion of the file, or data corruption.</li>
<li><strong>Destination host unreachable</strong><span>:</span> This error is associated with the <strong>Packet Internet Groper</strong> (the <kbd>ping</kbd> command) on a Linux or macOS system. On a Windows system, the message is likely to be <span class="packt_screen">Request timed out</span>. The issue is that either there is no clear path to the destination address, or it doesn't exist.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown host</strong><span>:</span> This error message results from an unreachable destination address. This could be a DNS problem, a configuration problem (such as the DNS server address), or just an incorrect destination address.</li>
<li><strong>Failure of the service provider</strong><span>:</span> An ISP is actually a single source of failure and, if for some reason the ISP's routing services are no longer available, access to the internet also stops. One way around this potential error is by subscribing to more than one ISP for service.</li>
<li><strong>Cannot resolve hostname/FQDN</strong><span>:</span> This error message indicates a problem with the information in the DNS server or the addressing to a remote site with either the hostname or the corresponding FQDN.</li>
</ul>

<p><kbd>ping</kbd> is a command line utility program used to verify a connection between a source host and a destination host. Using the FQDN, hostname, domain name, or the IP address entered, <kbd>ping</kbd> sends out a 64-byte ICMP echo request message to that destination. Anything other than the IP address passes through the DNS or the local <kbd>hosts</kbd> file. After sending out the ICMP message, <kbd>ping</kbd> waits for the echo response from the destination. When a response comes back, <kbd>ping</kbd> displays the metrics of the transmitted and received messages.</p>

<p>This command's purpose is to test and display the communication link between a source host and a destination host or network. <kbd>tracert</kbd> is the Windows version, and <kbd>traceroute</kbd> is the Linux/macOS version. This command uses an iterative process to incrementally test the path and connection to each of the routers on the path to a destination using the <strong>Time-to-Live</strong> (<strong>TTL</strong>) value. Initially, it sends out an ICMP echo request message with a TTL value of 1. This means that the router discards the message after reaching one router (hop) and only the first router on the path responds with the echo message. <kbd>tracert</kbd> then sends out another ICMP echo request, this time with a TTL value of 2. This process repeats until the TTL runs out (meaning the number of hops equals the default hop count), or until no incremental hops respond.</p>

<p>While the Windows <strong>Internet Protocol Configuration</strong> (<strong><kbd>ipconfig</kbd></strong>) command, or the workalike <strong>Interface Configuration</strong> (<strong><kbd>ifconfig</kbd></strong>) command, are available on virtually all other operating systems, it is helpful to learn the configuration elements of a host and its network interface(s). The following screenshot shows an excerpt from its <kbd>/all</kbd> option. This command also allows for releasing or renewing the DHCP configuration and several other configuration adjustments:</p>

<p>The <kbd>nslookup</kbd> command-line utility, in virtually all operating systems, looks up names and IP addresses in a name server (hence its name). Using <kbd>nslookup</kbd>, you can find the IP address or domain of a host on the network. The following screenshot shows an example of <kbd>nslookup</kbd> on a Linux system, which provides the IP address for a domain. As shown, the response is <span class="packt_screen">Non-authoritative answer</span>, which means this is the information in the DNS server at the present time:</p>

<p>The <kbd>net</kbd> command is actually more like a family of commands used to create a link to or to disconnect from a network shared resource, display all current connections on a host, share a resource with other hosts, manage passwords, control the print spooler, and more.</p>
<p>The <kbd>mount</kbd> command attaches (mounts) a filesystem or a secondary storage device. Mounting a device adds it to the active directory structure and makes its contents available for access. To dismount a mounted device or filesystem, the <kbd>umount</kbd> command notifies the operating system to complete any I/O operations to that unit and then remove it from the directory structure. Both the <kbd>net</kbd> and <kbd>mount</kbd> commands are available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>

<p><strong>NetBIOS over TCP/IP status</strong> (<span><strong>nbtstat</strong>) </span>is a command-line tool used primarily for diagnosing or troubleshooting NetBIOS name issues. It can also display the NetBIOS services running on another host, or display whether there is a logged-in user on a particular host.</p>
<p><strong>Network Status</strong> (<span><strong>netstat</strong>)</span> displays information on the IP configuration of a host, but goes further to show its connections, including ports, protocols, and metrics on the communications.</p>

<p>The link between a LAN and a WAN includes several components that could cause a link to fail, including cables, connections, NICs, gateways, and the ISP. A common problem is the configuration of hardware and software. Areas where configuration issues are common include the DHCP server, email server and clients, the <kbd>hosts</kbd> file, NICs, routers and switches, VLANs, default gateways, and firewalls.</p>
<p>In many cases, the messages that are displayed characterize a problem, but not necessarily its cause. These include <strong>resource unavailable</strong>, <strong>destination host unreachable</strong>, <strong>unknown host</strong>, <strong>failure of service provider</strong>, and cannot resolve hostname/FQDN.</p>
<p>Some of the network problem troubleshooting tools available are <kbd>ping</kbd>, <kbd>tracert</kbd>/<kbd>traceroute</kbd>, <kbd>ipconfig</kbd>, <kbd>nslookup</kbd>, <kbd>net use</kbd>, <kbd>mount</kbd>, <kbd>nbtstat</kbd>, and <kbd>netstat</kbd>.</p>
