    server or servers. This chapter covers the tools, components, tasks, processes,

    administrator or network administrator) can vary from one organization to another,
    but, for the most part, there is a core group of tasks they perform or oversee
    that are essential to virtually any environment. These tasks and responsibilities
    generally include monitoring hardware and software performance, user administration,
    managing backup and recovery procedures, and the application of fixes and patches
    to name just a few. This part of the Server+ certification exam is process-oriented,
    meaning that it is less about what you know (although that is still important)
    and more about what you do. Let's get to it!

    to monitoring, reviewing, reacting, and installing, when needed. You need to understand
    that a network administrator and a system administrator aren't exactly the same
    thing, but the workplace commonly uses these titles interchangeably. A system
    administrator's responsibilities often include those of the network administrator,
    but most organizations limit the scope of a network administrator's responsibilities
    to the configuration, operation, and installation of network hardware. So, since
    we're talking about hardware administration, we'll use the network administration
    title.

    such as the details of a system's configuration, the setup of an operating system,
    cabling specifications, service level agreements, change policies, personnel policies,
    authority structures, and the like. These documents tend to require less updating
    than, perhaps, main system documentation, but like it, they must be up to date.

    the processing or handling of classified or categorized documents, data, and outputs.
    In these cases, the government, its agencies, the military, and businesses of
    all sizes, must have a separate, specific, and documented policy on its storage,

    information facility** (**SCIF**) in which documents are in open storage, closed
    storage, or continuous operations. Many non-governmental organizations store sensitive
    documentation and other documents in locked, fire-proof cabinets, or small versions
    of bank vaults. In any case, sensitive documentation requires the same level of
    protection as the sensitive data or materials it references.

    We looked at two types of KVM devices—access and control and application and technology. 
    Examples of network-based hardware/software administration tools include KVM over
    IP, iLO , and iDRAC. The tools that are used to manage an OS on a remote system
    are RSAT, RDP, and SSH. VNC provides a GUI desktop. Command-line/shell commands
    can also control a remote system. Windows PowerShell facilities remote access
    and control and on a Linux system, command line over SSH provides remote system
    administration. An ITAM program manages  major asset groups and the IT asset life
    cycle.  An LCAM provides information on  life cycle and replacement equipment
    using  purchase, implement, maintain, support, and dispose.

    workstations. Types of documentation include service manuals, system and network
    documentation, architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, network diagrams, baseline
    documentation, and recovery documentation.  Effective documentation has clear
    language, relative information, completeness, and timely and accurate, as well
    as purpose, effectiveness, intended audience, and completeness. Documentation
    may include configuration, cable specifications, SLAs, and policies. Sensitive
    or classified documents, data, and outputs require special handling.
