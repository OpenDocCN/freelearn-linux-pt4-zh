    exam, you should have 18 to 24 months of information technology experience, preferably
    working with servers and networks. CompTIA also recommends that you hold the A+
    certification prior to taking the Server+ exam. It's not a bad idea to also have
    the Network+ certification, as well. However, none of these recommendations are
    requirements. If you believe you have the knowledge to pass the exam, give it
    a go. But, remember that it's $319.00 a pop.
