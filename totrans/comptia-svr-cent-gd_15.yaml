    Physical security is all about keeping the computing assets safe, functioning,
    secure, and away from all intruders. Although we'll treat it as a separate topic,
    the environmental systems and controls for the physical environment should be
    a part of an organization's security policies.

- en: Over the years in which users could access computers, systems, and networks,
    user authentication systems evolved from nearly nothing to combining multiple
    identity factors. This started with requiring user identity codes, then a secret
    password entered with the username, and now combining two or more identity factors.
    All of these levels had one primary purpose—to verify the identity of a user seeking
    access, as certainly as possible.

    command used by Ali Baba to access a treasure—*open sesame*. At one time, a user
    account or identity code served the purpose of identifying who was accessing a
    system, which was typically a mainframe or a minicomputer. Eventually, because
    of sharing among co-workers and their simplistic content, these codes ceased to
    provide any level of secure access control. User account codes, also known as
    usernames, commonly consisted of only a first initial and a last name of each
    user with access to the system, such as `rprice`. This a standard practice that's
    still in use today. Usernames haven't really changed much over their 50-year history,
    nor has the security they provide, which is essentially none.

    systems was primarily removable media, such as hard disk platters, spindle packs,
    magnetic tape, and floppy disks. Physical security that blocked access to the
    physical media was a large part of access control.
  prefs: []

- en: As application systems grew in sophistication, data storage was on attached
    or internal disk storage devices. This meant that security had to become an absolute
    necessity. Maintaining data integrity and security required stronger authentication
    methods. Adding a *secret* password to the login process helped to verify that
    a user requesting access to a system was in fact who he or she purported themselves
    to be. The underlying assumption was that if the user knew the password, then
    the user was who the username identified.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The use of a username is merely one step (the identification step) in an authentication
    process. Pairing a password with the username creates a data bundle that serves
    as a **single-factor authentication** (**SFA**) value. If the password entered
    is the value paired with the username in the system's security files, the system
    grants access to the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Eventually, the use of the combined username and password no longer provided
    the access control and security it once did. Password crackers, social engineering,
    malware, and other shady means were able to obtain user passwords that lead to
    accessing the user's personal data. This is where MFA came in.

    When the AC power source is constant, the UPS passes it through to its output

    wattage, or both. These values indicate the upper limit of the capabilities of
    a UPS's, and the power demand on it shouldn't exceed these ratings. The rule of
    thumb for sizing a UPS for smaller power demands, such as a single computer, is
    that the wattage rating shouldn't exceed roughly 60 percent of the VA rating.
    However, on larger systems, it's common that the wattage and the VA ratings are
    equal.

    and runtime. Capacity is the maximum amount of VA a UPS can output. Runtime, which
    is dependent on the size of the UPS battery, is the length of time the UPS can
    provide sufficient power to connected devices.
