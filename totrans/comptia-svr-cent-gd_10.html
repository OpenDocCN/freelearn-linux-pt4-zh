<p>Remember that computers, no matter how sophisticated or expensive, are still just machines, although electronic. Electronic devices have very few moving parts. In fact, outside of the read/write heads in a secondary storage device, the open and close drawer on optical storage devices, and maybe a couple of more moveable items, the overall design of computers doesn't include many moving parts. We could say that the electrical signals that move about the computer are <em>moving parts</em>, but bits and their transmission media don't really cause many failure issues and server maintenance is all about preventing failure and resolving problems as they arise. </p>
<p>This chapter covers the duties and activities of the system administrator relating to the maintenance of a network server. This includes the definition and execution of a change and patch application and management program, monitoring the performance and health of a server's outward-facing components, the process used to troubleshoot and resolve issues on a network server, and the application of fault tolerance and high-availability technology.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change and patch management</li>
<li>Performance monitoring</li>
<li>Hardware maintenance</li>
<li>Fault tolerance</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the context of system and server administration, change management programs, commonly known as change control programs, have one purpose above all others—the assurance that the application of the appropriate and necessary patches, updates, and configuration changes follows a formalized controlled, coordinated, and consistent methodology. The two terms—<strong>change management</strong> and <strong>change control</strong>—commonly refer to service maintenance and software maintenance, respectively. However, for the Server+ exam, change management refers to server and hardware maintenance in general and OS maintenance in particular.</p>
<p>A formalized change management or control program is a written, distributed, reviewed, approved, and implemented document. Depending on the size of the organization, the people involved at different phases of the program include the IT staff, a change review board or committee, and possibly the stakeholders who the change impacts. Of course, in a smaller organization, the process typically involves only two or three IT people, due to the limited scope and effect of changes. In a larger organization, the number of participants grows with the potential scope and effect of a change. In either case, the process structure directs the reviewing, testing, and application of any system change.</p>
<p>The purpose of the change management program in a server management environment should include the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deciding the proposed change is both needed or applicable</li>
<li>Identifying the impact of the proposed change and who or what it will affect</li>
<li>Testing the change in a non-production environment</li>
<li>Reviewing the results of the test</li>
<li>Gaining approval to apply the change in the live environment</li>
<li>Applying the change</li>
<li>Benchmarking the post-change environment</li>
</ul>

<p>The process that should be a part of a change management and control program has six phases. These phases are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Understand what the vendor says about what the proposed change is to correct, patch, fix, or improve and decide whether this is a change that is necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>: Any change has primary and secondary effects on a data center's current operations. Therefore, knowing the full impact of a proposed change is essential before proceeding. This knowledge should include who, as well as what.</li>
<li><strong>Approval</strong>: Someone other than the system administrator should review the analysis of the preceding steps and grant approval to proceed or identify areas for further analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong>: Test proposed changes on a non-production system before implementing them on the live systems.</li>
<li><strong>Implement</strong>: If the results of the non-production environment testing are as expected, apply the change to the production environment. After applying the change, benchmark the system's performance.</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong>: For a set time period, check the results of the applied change to ensure its continued success.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patch management</strong> is a part of change management and control, but its importance is less for the operational system tasks and capabilities than it is for the security of the system. The majority of patches (vendor-supplied updates and fixes) address vulnerabilities identified in a software product, such as an OS or major application package. The application of patches to a system should generally follow the approaches discussed in the previous two sections. However, patch management does have a few requirements of its own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patch management should be a priority</li>
<li>Maintain an accurate inventory of IT assets</li>
<li>Develop and apply a thorough testing process</li>
<li>Assign responsibility</li>
<li>Document the process, actions, and results</li>
</ul>
<p>In today's environment of malware, hackers, worms, Trojans, and other evil-doers, the time frame between the identification of a vulnerability (a weakness or flaw in a system that a hacker could exploit) and the issuance of a patch to close it, may be only a few hours. In system environments that must exhibit <strong>high availability</strong> (<strong>HA</strong>), the application of a patch could cause the system to be unavailable for an undetermined amount of time. The system administrator must analyze a patch for its appropriateness to the system and then decide on the best course for its implementation.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In larger, distributed data centers with remote locations managed from a central site, patch management (and change management for that matter) is a bit more complicated. Because of this, many use software tools, such as Microsoft's <strong>Security Configuration and Analysis</strong> (<strong>SCA</strong>) tool, <strong>Windows Server Update Services</strong> (<strong>WSUS</strong>), or <strong>System Center Configuration Manager</strong> (<strong>SCCM</strong>). Third-party patch management systems are available as either on-premise or cloud-based systems, such as SolarWinds Patch Manager (on-premise), ManageEngine Patch Manager Plus, or NinjaRMM (cloud-based).</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the patch management display of the NinjaRMM system:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">OS updates</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In addition to knowing if the <span><span>OS</span></span> is up-to-date and free of any known errors or bugs, applying fixes, patches, and updates is key to the security of the server and, most likely, its network. OS updates correct reported errors in the code and close vulnerabilities before or because of exploitation.</p>
<p>Most OS, including Windows, macOS, and many of the Linux distributions, include an automatic update feature. However, the update policy of the organization should direct whether this feature is enabled or disabled. Disabling automatic updates doesn't eliminate the administrator's ability to apply the update; it just won't happen automatically. Some OS updates can conflict with corrections or instructions inserted as workarounds for a flaw the patch is correcting. Prior to applying an update or patch, a thorough analysis of its effects and before and after testing should be a part of any change management procedure.</p>
<p>To enable or disable the automatic update features in Windows, macOS, and Linux , follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Server</strong>: On an <strong>Active Directory</strong> (<strong>AD</strong>) system, control of the automatic update function may be at the group level. The WSUS and the <span class="packt_screen">Windows Update</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Maintenance Scheduler</span> settings in Group Policy set the parameters for when, what, and how OS updates occur. Use these settings to disable automatic updates as well. In addition to OS updates, WSUS also updates Microsoft applications.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 7 and 8</strong>: The feature used to enable and disable automatic updates on a Windows 7 or earlier version is on the Control Panel under the <span class="packt_screen">System and Security</span> header and titled <span class="packt_screen">Windows Update</span>. This feature provides three options:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Turn automatic updating on and off</span>: If turned off, manual update is available through the Windows Update option on the Start Menu.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Check for updates</span>: This searches for unapplied updates that are available for the Windows OS, Microsoft Office, and other Microsoft services for manual application.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">View installed updates</span>: This lists the installed updates of the OS, including their coverage and when posted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows 10</strong>: Control of automatic updates is enabled or disabled through the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Windows Update</span> functions (see the following screenshot):</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909 image-border" src="Images/3eb40553-2d27-4e5e-8097-e00f0e63f58a.jpg" style="width:63.08em;height:41.33em;" width="757" height="496"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Windows 10: Windows Update page</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>macOS</strong>: Control of automatic or manual OS updates is effected through a page in the Apple Store. As shown in the following screenshot, there are three levels of control—automatically checking for updates; downloading and possibly installing the update; and downloading and installing previously purchased software installed on another macOS:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0cf47982-e94a-4d0f-90ea-ff17333c0ad9.jpg" style="width:41.33em;height:19.00em;" width="800" height="368"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The Apple macOS automatic update configuration</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: Each Linux distribution has an automatic update utility. For example, Ubuntu and Debian Linux releases have the <em>unattended-upgrades</em> <span>utility </span>that downloads and applies security updates and system patches. Another Linux utility for automatic updates is the <kbd>yum-cron</kbd> command and parameters in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and associated distributions.</li>

<p>Many system administrators follow the, <em>if it isn't broke, don't fix it</em>, approach to firmware updates, and only consider updates that are improving or adding security functions. However, there are reasons to upgrade the firmware, even when security isn't the issue. For example, when you add a newer hardware component to a relatively older computer, the computer most likely needs a BIOS/UEFI update to enable a compatible interface to the component. Consider firmware updates in the same way as an OS or application update. A firmware update may not affect a particular server or network and may not be necessary. It's also important to remember that a firmware update intended to fix a bug may have bugs of its own.</p>
<p>It's also a good practice to update the firmware of a computer when building it up as a server, or when the manufacturer of the computer or motherboard says that you should update the firmware. In either case, how you go about updating the firmware varies among manufacturers of motherboards and computers. Check the manufacturer's website for the process and application instructions.</p>

<p>In networks that require high availability, network and system administrators must rely on a variety of monitoring, error notification, and troubleshooting guides to detect and alert them when problems occur. On high-availability systems, downtime is not an option. All support and maintenance activities focus on ensuring uptime and availability. In the following sections, we look at some of the tools available to assist administrators in achieving these goals.</p>

<p>Server monitors provide system administrators with automated reporting, scheduled device checking, and warnings that a device or system may be nearing or has reached a preset threshold or ceiling setting and requires preemptive troubleshooting. The majority of server monitoring systems include checks and measurements and reporting, if necessary, in relation to the major systems, subsystems, and components of a network server, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU usage</strong>: High CPU utilization can impact response times and productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Hard disk space</strong>: Low disk space can lead to slower performance, missing updates, high fragmentation, and slow indexed searches.</li>
<li><strong>Disk <span>input/output operations per second (</span>IOPS)</strong>: Disk IOPS is a benchmark measurement that indicates the operating efficiency of a secondary storage device.</li>
<li><strong>RAID health</strong>: RAID systems can have a variety of issues, such as controller failings, errors in partitioning, and, of course, one or more physical disk drive failures.</li>
<li><strong>RAM utilization</strong>: High RAM utilization can cause slower runtimes, throughput, and perhaps system or application crashes.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware status</strong>: A poorly performing hardware component can slow or halt a network server. Proactively checking hardware health and processing capacity may avoid system downtime.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>System temperatures</strong>: Several components in a server (or network node) are sensitive to high heat, including the microprocessor, which is why system temperatures need monitoring (see the following screenshot):</li>
</ul>

<p>Computer systems designed for use as a network server have one or more sets of LEDs on the motherboard, rear panel, or front panel, or some combination of these locations.

<p>In place of or in addition to LED indicators, several server systems display server status information on a small LCD that typically has one line of text limited to between 25 and 65 characters. Should an issue occur during the POST or a subsequent configuration, a short message displays on the LCD screen, like the examples given in the following table. This display is often exclusive to the server display and not displayed on the administrator console.

<p>When you power on a PC, a firmware utility, called the <strong>power-on self-test</strong> (<strong>POST</strong>), checks the internal hardware components included in the BIOS or UEFI configuration. The POST checks each of the components for its presence (connection), compatibility, and function (response). If all is well, the POST issues an all-clear signal and continues the start up procedure. The signal given is generally a single <em>beep</em> tone, but some systems may beep twice.</p>
<p>However, should the POST encounter a problem, meaning the PC fails the POST, one of two things may happen—a beep code pattern is emitted that indicates the nature of the problem detected, or there is a power-off without sounding a beep. Beep codes, also known as POST error codes, where used, provide a general indication of the component causing the POST fail. It could be a bad connection, a removed device, or, perhaps, a failed device. The purpose of the beep codes is to provide a starting point for troubleshooting the issue.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Beep codes are a part of the BIOS/UEFI module stored in a ROM or NVRAM chip. Unfortunately, there is no standard, and each manufacturer can use a different beep code pattern scheme in its computers. Even different BIOS products of a single company may have completely different code meanings. As shown in the following table, the three manufacturers shown, while using the same beep code patterns, each assign a different issue or condition to their codes. A short tone or beep is a quick beep that is about one-tenth of a second in length. A long tone is about twice as long:</p>

<p>The components that make up the hardware of a network server are in two major groups, each with its own handling, installation procedures, and complexity. The following table shows the categories of several server components.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer-Replaceable Units (CRUs)</strong>: These are the components that a user/customer is able to remove and replace. CRUs fall into levels of difficulty, such as a CRU 1 being relatively simple to replace and a CRU 3 being more difficult. In some systems, a CRU N or CRU X indicates a component that a user should not attempt to replace. Examples of CRUs are monitors, keyboards, batteries, and all external devices.</li>
<li><strong>Field-Replaceable Units (FRUs)</strong>: These are the components that only a qualified field service representative should remove and replace. Examples of FRUs include hard disk drives, motherboards, internal control units, fans, backplanes, and memory:</li>

<p>Unfortunately, computers, and especially servers, aren't <em>set 'em and forget 'em</em> devices. They require constant monitoring and administration. A very large part of these efforts is to organize a schedule of preventive maintenance activities, followed and recorded assiduously. They are necessary for just about every scheduling frequency: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, and perhaps between them.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of preventive maintenance is to avoid device or component failure, which creates corrective or restorative maintenance. Just like taking a flu shot helps to prevent getting sick with the flu, a solid <strong>preventive maintenance</strong> (<strong>PM</strong>) program can prevent serious problems down the road. Of course, the PM program is typically different for every system, data center, and network, but there is a list of tasks that any PM program should include.</p>

<p>One of the terms used to describe server systems that are able to resist failures is <em>hardened</em>. While hardening is most associated with closing unused ports and other vulnerabilities, to achieve a <span>truly</span><span> </span><span>hardened system usually requires the application of fault-tolerance techniques.</span></p>
<p>When one component fails, it may affect the function of another component, which then affects the functions of yet another component. This chain reaction of failing components creates a condition of cascading failure, which is not a good thing. There are several methods through which a server can be fault (fail) tolerant, meaning the server is able to withstand a component failure and stay available, achieving high availability.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Where a server is generally a single computer running server software, a server cluster consists of servers arranged in an interactive group. The general purpose of a server cluster is to improve process throughput and responsiveness to users. A server cluster has two or more interconnected servers that operate as a single unit under the control of a primary or load-balancing server or controller.</p>
<p>The primary benefits provided by server clustering are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: In situations where network or user demands exceed the capabilities of an existing cluster, it's relatively easy to incorporate additional servers into the cluster to handle the increased volume.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: A single server is both a single point of failure and, at times, a bottleneck. A server cluster spreads the processing load across several servers, which is likely to withstand the failure of a single server in the cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Manageability</strong>: Maintenance on a single server generally requires downtime. However, a cluster of servers provides continuity of operations, while one or more of the clustered devices receive maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some disadvantages to server clustering, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: A server cluster requires more computers and support infrastructure, which adds to the expense of maintaining the system.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Not all computers designed as servers are cluster-friendly. Clustering is a fairly rigid structure and beyond add-on scalability is not very flexible. Some software applications aren't cluster-compatible either.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>:<strong> </strong>Clustering can be expensive and its design must be carefully set to work efficiently, increasing the cost of administration and management.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two primary configurations for server clusters are <strong>active/active</strong> and <strong>active/passive</strong>. Each of these configurations can be a strategy for high availability. An active/active server cluster is commonly a load-balancing solution that interconnects two or more computers that perform the same processing steps. As depicted in the following diagram, a blade server chassis holds several active servers. A load-balancing appliance or server manages the process assignments to the servers optimizing the response time of the network:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">An example of an active/active server cluster</div>
<p>By contrast, an active/passive server cluster configuration, as shown in the following diagram, also has two or more interconnected servers, and may have one or more active servers sharing the processing load and one or more failover, backup, or standby servers ready to replace a failed server or one taken out of service for maintenance:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Load balancing</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As discussed above, load balancing is a function that distributes incoming network traffic to two or more servers arranged in a pool, farm, or cluster. Load balancing can be performed by specific software, a hardware appliance, or a dedicated computer. A load-balancing server or appliance enables a client/server application or a content provider to even out high volumes by spreading the incoming service requests over the available capacity of the server group. In effect, a load balancer is a form of router. Where a router directs traffic based on the best path to a destination, the load balancer directs traffic to a server with the appropriate software or data or, like a router, the load balancer directs the traffic to the best available server.</p>
<p>The primary functions of a load-balancing application or appliance is to distribute incoming client requests for service to the server cluster to achieve efficiency, provide high availability by balancing its traffic only to active servers, and to provide flexibility by permitting administrators to add or remove servers to and from the cluster as needed.</p>
<p>Load balancers use a variety of algorithms to determine the server in a cluster or group to which an incoming message goes for processing. The most common of the load-balancing algorithms used are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agent-based adaptive load balancing</strong>: This is a supplemental algorithm used in conjunction with a <em>weighted</em> algorithm. Each server in the cluster has an agent that interacts with the load balancer to provide a real-time update on its server's status. The load balancer uses this data to determine which server will process the request.</li>
<li><strong>Chained failover</strong>: The servers in the processing group or cluster form a serial chain. Incoming messages go to the first server in the chain. If that server isn't able to service the message, it passes to the next server for processing. If that server is unable to provide processing, the message passes along until a server is able to process it.</li>
<li><strong>Least connections</strong>: Neither of the round robin algorithms consider the current load of the server group when deciding where to send a message. However, the least connections algorithm looks at the load on each of the servers and assigns a message to the server with the least number of active processes.</li>
<li><strong>Round robin</strong>: In an active/active cluster, every server is able to process the message traffic equally. While all of the load balancers and each of the servers all share the same domain name, each has a unique IP address assigned. The primary DNS server for this domain associates the domain name with each of the IP addresses in the cluster. When a request asks for the IP address for the cluster domain, it's provided with a server IP. The IP address provided for the domain name rotates after each DNS request. </li>
<li><strong>Software-defined networking (SDN) adaptive</strong>: This load-balancing technique combines data about the network from the Presentation and Transport Layers with data from the Data Link and Network Layers to learn the status of the servers and their active applications, the status of the network itself, and whether there is any congestion or blockage on the network medium to make its load<span>-</span>balancing decision.</li>
<li><strong>Source IP hash</strong>: This algorithm converts the source and destination IP addresses of the client and server and hashes them together to create a key that it uses to forward the message to a particular server. The hash key is recalculable should processing interrupt and restart.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted least connection</strong>: The servers in the cluster or group receive a weighted value based on their resources and capabilities. Servers with more resources receive higher values. This value combines with the connections count of each server to determine a server prioritization. Servers with more resources get a bigger share of the load.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted response time</strong>: An intermittent server response time check sets a ranking for servers based on their response times. A server under a heavier processing load responds more slowly than a server with a lighter load, resulting in the servers with the fastest response times receiving more messages—at least until the response time check repeats.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted round robin</strong>: In addition to the basic round robin algorithm, each server receives a weighting factor. The servers with higher weightings receive a larger share of the incoming messages.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>A heartbeat mechanism, also known as a </span>heartbeat network or heartbeat protocol, is a common distribution method in a clustered server arrangement. Each of the clustered servers communicates with a synchronizing server, or <em>sync</em>, that it is up and operating by sharing that they have a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Each of the active servers in the cluster periodically sends a heartbeat message to the <em>sync</em>, indicating its health. The sync adds the heartbeat messages to the bottom of a <strong>first-in/first-out</strong> (<strong>FIFO</strong>) push-up stack. The top entry in the FIFO stack identifies to the load balancer or cluster manager which of the active servers is next to receive a message request. However, if a server fails to provide its heartbeat message in the allotted time, the sync assumes that the server doesn't have a heartbeat and is therefore unavailable.</p>

<p>A <strong>high-availability</strong> (<strong>HA</strong>) strategy aims to keep a server, network, or cloud service running and available to users and subscribers without the need to take the server down to change out a failed or idled component. HA programs can address several aspects of server availability, including data restoration, server failover, component replacement, and disaster recovery. On the Server+ exam, you should expect to see a question or two concerning component replacement and the differences between hot-swappable and non-hot-swappable devices and procedures.</p>

<p>In spite of its common usage, hot plugging is not hot swapping. Typically, a hot plug device will connect to the system through plug and play, but often there is still another step required to complete the installation. On the other hand, a hot swap device installs on a running computer and is immediately usable.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most common hot swap device is a <strong>Universal Serial Bus</strong> (<strong>USB</strong>) flash memory drive. While USB flash drives aren't typically secondary storage on a network server, other USB, FireWire, Thunderbird, and eSATA devices, such as external storage devices, network adapters, and other peripheral devices, are generally hot swappable. Components usually thought of as internal devices, such as power supplies and hard disk drives, can also be hot swappable. However, not all power supplies and hard disk drives are hot swappable, and not all computers support hot swapping.</p>

<p>The primary difference between a hot swappable device and a non-hot swappable device is that the replacement of a non-hot swappable device typically requires a reboot of the computer. Regardless of how fast a system reboot completes, the system was not available to users during that time. This method of device replacement is a warm swap.</p>
<p>Another not-hot device replacement method is a cold swap that requires a system shutdown (powered down).</p>

<p>An SLA is a common instrument provided by a service provider to the service subscriber. The essential elements of an information system SLA are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parties</strong>: The specific identification of all of the parties to the agreement or their agents listing their authorities and abilities under the agreement</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>: The services specifically covered by the agreement, defined by function, procedure, actions, time, and pertinent metrics</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: A specification of the time, volumes, duration, acceptable performance, unacceptable performance, uptime commitment, downtime limits, and agreed-to metrics and thresholds</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: If the implementation of the covered services is on a schedule, the agreement must specify the timelines, tasks, objectives, and acceptance or completion criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Other areas typical to an SLA are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scheduled downtime</strong>: A delineation of any agreed-upon scheduled system downtime, during which access is unavailable</li>
<li><strong>Unscheduled downtime</strong>: <em>What are the rights of the service subscriber in the event the system suffers unscheduled, extended, or catastrophic downtime, and what are the agreed-upon recovery requirements of the service provider?</em></li>
<li><strong>Client notification</strong>: The SLA should detail the methods the service provider will use to notify the subscriber of changes in system status and define the amount of time for a notification of a scheduled downtime event</li>
<li><strong>Mean time to repair/restoration (MTTR)</strong>: A committed downtime duration, either historical, an estimate, or industry data, in the event of unanticipated downtime</li>

<p>Change management programs ensure that the necessary patches, updates, and changes follow a controlled and consistent process. Change management in a server environment should follow six phases—purpose, scope, approval, testing, implementation, and review. Patch management is a part of change management and control. Patch management should be a priority. Firmware updates generally fix a bug.</p>
<p>Server monitors provide automated reporting, scheduled device checking, and threshold and troubleshooting warnings for CPU usage, hard disk space, and utilization, disk IOPS, RAM utilization, and network traffic. The components of a network server are either CRUs or FRUs. Preventive maintenance avoids device or component failure.</p>
<p>The purpose of a server cluster is to improve process throughput and responsiveness to users through two or more interconnected servers operating as a single unit under the control of a primary or load-balancing server. The two configurations for server clusters are active/active and active/passive. An active/active server cluster is a load-balancing solution that interconnects two or more computers that perform the same processing steps. An active/passive server cluster has interconnected servers and one standby server to replace a failed server.</p>
<p>Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic to two or more servers to spread incoming service requests over the capacity of the server group. An HA strategy keeps a server available to users during the change-out of a failed component. A hot swappable device installs on a running computer and is immediately usable. A non-hot swappable device requires a reboot of the computer.</p>
<p>An SLA is a common instrument provided by a service provider to the service subscriber. The essential elements of an information system SLA are parties, services, performance, and implementation. Other areas typical to an SLA include scheduled downtime, unscheduled downtime, client notification, and MTTR.</p>
