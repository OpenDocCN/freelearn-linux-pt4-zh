Since CentOS users rely almost exclusively on the community for their support needs, I was keen to write this book when Packt approached me about the project's latest release, CentOS 7. The recipes we chose cover a wide range of topics, from getting started to managing many common web services, and hopefully administrators of any skill level will find something of interest.</p><p>However, writing a book is a huge undertaking. Because of this, I want to thank the staff at Packt, my family, and my friends, for their support. The dog needs to be taken for a walk, family engagements need attending, and emergencies arise at the workplace. Without the understanding and encouragement of those around me and the editorial staff, you wouldn't be reading this book.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>The recipes presented in this book aim to make even the most difficult configuration tasks easy by providing step-by-step instructions and discussion.

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec2"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To follow the recipes in this book, first and foremost you'll need a system capable of running CentOS 7. The minimum requirements (and maximum capabilities) are documented in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux knowledge base available online at <a class="ulink" href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits">https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits</a>. In brief, you'll need a system that has the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">x86_64 processor (RHEL/CentOS 7 does not support x86)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">1 GB RAM</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">8 GB Disk capacity</li></ul></div><p>Apart from a system to install CentOS on, you'll also need a copy of the CentOS installation media and a working network connection. You can download a copy directly from <a class="ulink" href="https://www.centos.org/download/">https://www.centos.org/download/</a> or using BitTorrent.</p></div>
