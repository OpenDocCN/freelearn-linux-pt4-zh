- en: In this chapter, we will discuss how an end user can connect to their virtual
    desktops and published applications using the various Horizon Client options that
    are available. We will also cover the different types of hardware-based endpoint
    devices that exist. The job of the client is to receive and display the screenshots
    of virtual desktop machines and the published applications on the end users' devices
    and then send the keystrokes and mouse movements back. These are the keystrokes
    and mouse movements from the end users client device, that get sent across the
    network back to the virtual desktop session.

    one over the other, based on the use case at hand. So, let's start by looking
    at the software-based client options.

    machine from their client device using a piece of software called the Horizon
    View Client. The Horizon View Client is installed onto the local client device
    and allows users to communicate with the View Connection Server, allowing them
    to authenticate, select a desktop or application from a desktop pool they are
    entitled to, and then establish the connection between the client and the virtual
    desktop machine.

    device is irrelevant when you're connecting to a virtual desktop machine as it's
    just a dumb device to access the infrastructure and display my desktop screen,
    so that means I can buy the cheapest device possible and that will be fine, right?
  prefs: []

    their requirements in terms of features and functionality are. Then, you can choose
    the most suitable endpoint device for them to connect from.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A thin client is a hardware endpoint device that's used to connect to the network
    and deliver a remote desktop/application session. Unlike a traditional PC that
    has its own memory, storage, and computing power to run applications on its own,
    complete with a full-blown OS and applications installed locally, a thin client
    has a cut-down OS, minimal CPU, memory, and often no storage and relies on the
    computing power of the servers running in the data center to do all of the processing.
    In this case, the thin client is used as a means to display the server's content
    to the end user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, a client device will have just enough processing power and resources
    to access and use the computing resources of the server. They have little or no
    storage (just enough to host their own internal OS) and more importantly no moving
    parts, which means they don't go wrong very often. Due to the reduced CPU and
    memory capacity, a thin client will draw a fraction of the power that a PC would
    normally need, meaning that thin clients should be cheaper to run and manage,
    and they have longer life cycles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing they do have in common with a PC is that they have an operating system.
    A thin client will have its own local operating system installed, typically embedded
    on a flash card, and would be running the vendor's own cut-down version of a Linux
    distribution such as Dell Wyse ThinOS or Microsoft Windows Embedded. In addition,
    it would be running the appropriate client software to connect to the appropriate
    virtual desktop infrastructure, such as a Horizon Client with PCoIP to connect
    to VMware View-based virtual desktops and hosted apps, and the Citrix Receiver
    to connect to a Citrix-based infrastructure, and so on. Usually, a thin client
    will have all of the connection options installed, giving you the choice and flexibility
    to connect to different infrastructures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, this is where you need to make the right choice regarding a device, as
    the operating system will be embedded onto the device. As we mentioned previously,
    the use case for the user will typically dictate the type of device. For example,
    if you are going to deploy unified communications with Microsoft Skype for Business,
    then you will need a Windows Embedded operating system, as it will more than likely
    require some of the Windows multimedia functionality. Always check before going
    off and buying the cheapest device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also a couple of other points to bear in mind with thin clients. If
    the device is running on a local operating system, this will still need to be
    managed and maintained. The other consideration relates to licensing and the fact
    that you will need a Windows VDA license if you are connecting from a non-Windows
    device. This needs to be taken into account when looking at cost models and looking
    at TCO and ROI.

- en: Zero Clients
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Zero Client performs the same functionality as a thin client; however, instead
    of an operating system, a Zero Client will have a highly tuned on-board processor
    that's been specifically designed for one of the VDI protocols (PCoIP, HDX, or
    RemoteFX). For example, the VMware View-based Zero Clients would use the onboard
    Tera2 hardware chipset such as a Dell Wyse 5030/7030 or a 10ZiG V1200-P. These
    devices are still small, light, have no moving parts, and consume minimal power,
    just like a thin client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The decoding and display processes take place on the silicon of the Zero Client
    and are more efficient. Since they are a hardware-based solution, they deliver
    better performance than if you were to use a software client with a standard CPU
    and GPU. Zero Clients boot up in just a few seconds as there is no operating system
    to load. As such, they are far more immune to viruses and other malware as they
    have next to no storage or data stored on them. This decreases the overall downtime
    of the device, meaning there are very few failures, mainly due to the lack of
    moving parts. This increases productivity to the end user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Zero Client device does not require any major maintenance and it rarely needs
    any updates, that is, unless there is a remarkable change or improvement to the
    VDI protocol or a rare BIOS-related update.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a couple of things to watch out for. First is the licensing. Since
    these devices are not running on an operating system, you need to look at VDA
    licensing for using a non-Windows device. The final thing is that, if you change
    your VDI infrastructure from PCoIP to a new protocol, then the device cannot be
    used with a different protocol, so you lose the flexibility that you get with
    a thin client. However, you will get much better performance.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also possible to repurpose existing physical PCs so that they can be used
    as thin clients. There are a number of ways to achieve this, but you must ensure
    it is simple for the user to use and does not confuse the usage between a virtual
    desktop machine and the physical desktop machine that is sitting in front of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a couple of ways to do this. First is to use a local policy or group
    policy to lock down the Windows PC and change the shell to the Horizon Client
    only. The second is to use a third-party solution, such as the market leading
    ThinKiosk solution from ThinScale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The ThinKiosk solution enables any Windows-based endpoint device to be repurposed
    into a centrally managed, secure, Windows-based thin client. For end users, it
    delivers an intuitive and familiar-looking user interface with a secure workspace
    environment that it can access remote or local resources from. It''s an ideal
    solution for migrating to VDI, as you can continue to use local apps and resources
    while maintaining security. This also means that you won''t be held back when
    moving to VDI due to the apps not working in virtual environments and newer operating
    systems. When it comes to security, ThinScale''s Secure Remote Worker solution
    allows an end user to launch an app that is essentially a temporary, secure, workspace
    environment that runs on any Windows device and is designed to allow home and
    remote workers to use their own devices:'
