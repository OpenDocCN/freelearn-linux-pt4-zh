<p>Data security requires constant attention and scrutiny to ensure that stored data, data in transit, and data in use is under the <strong>confidential, integrity,</strong> and <strong>availability</strong> (<strong>CIA</strong>) model. In this chapter, we look at the security issues, problems, and consequences of gaps in or the absence of safeguards to protect a network's data, software, and hardware resources. The problems, causes, and tools discussed in this chapter are the topics and concepts you should expect to see on the Server+ exam. The general topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common data security problems</li>
<li>Causes of common security problems</li>
<li>Commonly used security tools and their use</li>
</ul>

<p>Network servers, regardless of their application, must deal with a variety of security issues, attacks, and, in some cases, harm. These problems aren't specifically related to hardware or software, but they are problems. The security problems you should understand include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File integrity</strong>: File integrity means that data and program files have not been the target of an attack and modified in any way by an unauthorized person or function. An attacker, either internal or external, can compromise the integrity of a file purposefully or accidentally. Monitoring the integrity of stored data and programs should be a part of a standard monitoring procedure. <strong>File integrity monitor</strong> (<strong>FIM</strong>) software uses checksums and hashing to detect changes to a file. The most common hashing algorithm used is <strong>Message Digest 5</strong> (<strong>MD5</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Privilege escalation</strong>: This is an attack on the resources of a system or network in which the attacker is able to expand or elevate his or her rights and permissions to access resources with higher restrictions. There are two types of privilege escalation:
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical</strong>: This is the nominal privilege escalation, also known as, privilege elevation, in which a user (attacker) or application (malware) with low assigned privileges is able to access data, programs, or other content with higher privileges, rights, and permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal</strong>: In this type of privilege escalation attack, a user increases his or her permissions and rights so that he or she is able to access resources reserved or assigned to another user or user group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applications will not load</strong>: In the security settings of a Windows system, the ownership of a resource can affect the performance of an application from that resource. One common issue is that the Windows Update service isn't running. As suspicious as that may be, the problem could also be the ownership of a resource. The ownership designation of a partition, folder, or file controls who and what can read, write, or execute its contents.<br/>
To change the ownership, access <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span> on the hard disk from File Explorer (see the following screenshot). In addition, malware may have removed, renamed, or corrupted the disk, partition, or file. On a Linux system, the issue is likely the same and the remedy is too. Change the ownership of the filesystem, directory, or file as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1157 image-border" src="Images/24f35dff-aaba-4afa-8324-520ded5bc203.jpg" style="width:39.83em;height:33.58em;" width="751" height="634"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Changing the ownership of a disk drive</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cannot access network file/shares</strong>: Somewhere in the chain of objects, elements, and devices between a network server and a host, the request to access a shared resource is failing. This means that the network adapter on either computer, the permissions of the remote user on the server, the permissions of the resource, and whether or not the resource is actually set as a share could be the issue.</li>
<li><strong>Unable to open files</strong>: This error and other similar messages are generally the result of the following:
<ul>
<li>Problems with the file, application, or service itself (see the following screenshot)</li>
<li>A third-party application that is not quite compatible with the operating system</li>
<li>A newly installed application or file that is in conflict with the anti-malware software</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">On a Windows system, there are a few more potential causes for this error:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>User Account Control</strong> (<strong>UAC</strong>) is not enabled.</li>
<li>Certain applications will not open for the <strong>Built-in Administrator</strong> (<strong>BIA</strong>) account; log off and change the logged-in account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">On a Linux or a macOS system, the issues are likely a conflict of installed services:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">A file blocked for opening</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excessive access</strong>: One of the core principles of resource access is the principle of least privilege, which says a user should only have access to the resources absolutely needed to complete or carry out their assigned task. If a particular user account, especially a remote user account, is accessing a specific data resource beyond reasonableness, it may be something to look into. The log files should provide the information needed to make a judgement on what may be excessive access. Another consideration is to verify that the access is, in fact, made by a person.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive memory utilization</strong>: High memory consumption can be an indication of a security issue, such as malware or an unauthorized user accessing data, or it could be excessive memory leaks. On a Windows system, use the Windows Memory Diagnostic utility to see what is taking up space in RAM. On Linux or macOS, the <kbd>syslog</kbd> log file may contain information on out of memory conditions and the <kbd>free -m</kbd> command enables you to see the allocation of memory usage.</li>

<p>When you detect a security event that is underway, there is only so much you can do to stop it, block its damage, and mitigate the exploited vulnerability immediately. After recovering or rectifying the damage, your next task is to identify the vulnerability and the cause of the exploitation. The cause of common security problems is an area where the Server+ exam places some emphasis, so expect to see questions relating to the topics in the following list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active services</strong>: Operating systems all start a group of services when they boot up and these services may start up other services (dependencies). A part of the security procedures on any server should be a periodical audit of the services actively running on it. The services audit should also note which TCP/UDP ports are in use and by which services. More active services can mean more vulnerabilities and threats. The information gained in the services audit can also help to structure the network's firewall and router rules. On a Windows system, list the active services using the <kbd>net start</kbd> command (see the following screenshot):</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1161 image-border" src="Images/b007c40f-b0ae-4e67-9859-62042528e1b9.jpg" style="width:28.42em;height:26.67em;" width="800" height="751"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"> A portion of a list of the active services on a Windows system</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span>On a Linux system, the </span><kbd><span>service --status-all</span></kbd><span> command lists active services (see the following screenshot):</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1162 image-border" src="Images/24effbd5-56de-4463-aeb4-7eb326d9b143.jpg" style="width:30.17em;height:33.08em;" width="811" height="889"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The active services on a Linux system</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inactive accounts</strong>: There is a big difference between an inactive account and a disabled account. An inactive account has not signed on or been active in a defined period of time. A disabled account is not available without being enabled. Administrators should monitor inactive accounts closely because they are usable accounts that could be a wide-open vulnerability door.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-malware configurations</strong>: Beyond choosing the best antivirus or anti-malware software for the organization's computing and networking needs, the configuration of that software is as important as the rules applied to a firewall and router, maybe more. In a networked environment, it is a server-based, anti-malware system that scans and protects all of the network's nodes automatically. But, the quality of that protection is a direct product of the anti-malware system's configuration. At minimum, the anti-malware's configuration should address the following issues:
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>: A full scan of all computers on the network every day. This includes the servers, of course, but also the network hosts. Schedule scans when the least number of humans are on the network.</li>
<li><strong>Updates</strong>: Update malware databases or signature files automatically from the publisher's website as soon as the updates are available.</li>
<li><strong>Devices</strong>: All allowed removable data storage devices should be as much a part of the anti-malware scan as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong>: Review all anti-malware log files daily for alerts, false negatives, false positives, and other configuration-related errors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Misconfigured permissions</strong>: On larger networks, it's common for user account permissions to become conflicting with the permissions of the groups to which the user is a member. In either case, group or user, the application of the principle of least privilege can prevent the users of a group or any individual users having access to more than they need.</li>
<li><strong>Open ports</strong>: An open port is one that is enabled and <em>listening</em> for incoming IP addresses and port number combinations (sockets). Each open port is essentially an open door that an intruder could exploit. Hardening a server includes disabling all unnecessary open ports. The following screenshot shows <kbd>netstat</kbd> listing the active ports on a Windows system:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1163 image-border" src="Images/ba14c703-344f-4ba9-94ac-e4750e2660ee.jpg" style="width:44.17em;height:29.17em;" width="765" height="504"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">List the active ports using netstat</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rogue processes/services</strong>: A rogue process or service is one that is running on a computer that the user or operator did not initiate and is consuming resources, causing destruction, and performing mayhem. Regardless of what it's doing, kill it, but not in a physical, bloody way; in a humane, logical way. The key to killing it is to get its <strong>process ID</strong> (<strong>PID</strong>) first. In Windows, use the Task Manager (where you can also try to end it all) and in Linux or macOS, the <kbd>ps</kbd> command lists this information. The following screenshots show the PID numbers in the Windows Task Manager and a Linux <kbd>ps</kbd> command, respectively. With the PID, you can use the <kbd>taskkill &lt;PID&gt;</kbd> command in Windows (at the command line), or the <kbd>kill</kbd> command in Linux/macOS:</li>

<p>Like any skilled professional, such as a plumber, carpenter, or mechanic, a system administrator has a toolbox of tools specially made for the tasks and processes required to carry out his or her tasks. The following list shows the tools you need to be familiar with for the Server+ exam:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Port scanners</strong>: This is a software application that scans a server (or host) to identify any open TCP/UDP ports. An open port is a possible entry point for an external attacker. Port scanners allow server administrators to ensure that the state of the server complies with the security policies of its organization. Not all port scanners scan for the full range of TCP/UDP port numbers. Some scan for only the well-known ports, others scan for the ports most commonly exploited, and yet others scan for the full range of port numbers (up to <kbd>65536</kbd>).<br/>
A port scan assigns one of three states to each port—<span class="packt_screen">Open</span> (accepted), <span class="packt_screen">Closed</span> (denied), or <span class="packt_screen">Filtered</span> (blocked). The open ports pose the highest security vulnerabilities. The following screenshot shows an example of a port scanner utility:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1167 image-border" src="Images/b9a6b125-ea96-4ba7-b531-37b733fdb9fc.jpg" style="width:83.33em;height:38.25em;" width="1000" height="459"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The SolarWind port scanner</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sniffers</strong>: Also known as packet sniffers, <strong>sniffers</strong> are utility software that examine the contents of network packet traffic. A sniffer's role depends on who is using it. System and network administrators use sniffers to monitor incoming network traffic, which could be part of an intrusion detection or prevention objective. Attackers use sniffers to obtain passwords, usernames, account numbers, and other <strong>personally identifiable information</strong> (<strong>PII</strong>). Sniffers can be hardware appliances or software programs. A <strong>snoop server</strong> is a sniffer configured in promiscuous mode, which captures and examines all network traffic. Only the destination node examines a packet in non-promiscuous mode. Sniffing can also be active or passive.</li>
<li><strong>Cipher</strong>: In the context of server security, this term refers to an algorithm used to convert plain text into cipher text. In other words, the process used to encrypt or decrypt data. There are two basic types of ciphers—<strong>transposition ciphers</strong> and <strong>substitution ciphers</strong>. A transposition cipher shifts the characters of a string to hide their original order. For example, <em>ABCDE</em> may become <em>EACBD</em>. More sophisticated transposition ciphers may shift the bits of the string's characters.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A substitution cipher, at its simplest, assigns each character an alias value that replaces the original character in a string. The following screenshot shows an example of a substitution cipher:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1168 image-border" src="Images/99bafeb2-eb8d-4615-852b-4c552d1400e4.jpg" style="width:39.08em;height:9.08em;" width="779" height="181"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">An example of the use of a substitution cipher</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checksums</strong>: This is a value generated by an algorithm that consists of a sequence of characters that represents the contents of the original string. A checksum calculated on a copy of an original file, packet, string, or any other digital object should match the original checksum, indicating they are identical. The checksum algorithms in common use are the MD5, <strong>Secure Hash Algorithm</strong> (<strong>SHA</strong>)-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512. The numbers of these names refer to different things. The <em>5</em> in MD5 is a version number, as is the <em>1</em> in SHA-1. The numbers in SHA-256 and SHA-512 represent the numbers of bits in the signature (hash value) they generate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The following table shows an example of the generated signatures from the checksum algorithms mentioned:</p>

<li><strong>Telnet</strong>: Short for teletype network, Telnet has been around since the late 1960s and has been used to establish a command-line interface on a remote device, which is essentially how it's still used today. A Telnet client is available on virtually all operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and even those on access points, routers, firewalls, and other networking devices. Because Telnet preceded most internet protocol developments, it doesn't provide any form of encryption, which means its communications are all <em>in the clear</em>. Other tools that perform the same functions as Telnet are PuTTY, which is a Telnet work-alike that adds <strong>Secure Shell</strong> (<strong>SSH</strong>) encryption. Other alternatives are Microsoft PowerShell for Windows and <kbd>netcat</kbd> for macOS. The following screenshot shows the command set and options for the <kbd>telnet</kbd> command:</li>
