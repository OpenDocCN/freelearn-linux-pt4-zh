<p>For all that goes into the processes surrounding disaster recovery, it's hoped that it will never be necessary. The complexity of a disaster recovery program rises and falls with the size, locale, diversity, and application of the systems involved. Smaller system environments can protect themselves against a disaster merely by regularly taking a backup of their systems. Larger data center environments that support distributed systems, large networks, virtualization, and perhaps a cloud service, have a much more complicated task in identifying the required elements of continuity and their sequence for recovery—<span>n</span>ot to mention, exactly how soon and where the recovery is to happen. A medium-sized operation falls somewhere in between these two extremes.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will review the definitions, methods, products, and applications involved in disaster recovery and business continuity planning and execution. We will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuity of operations</li>
<li>Recovery</li>
<li>Backups and replication</li>
</ul>

<p>There's more to what goes into a fully formed disaster recovery plan than just nailing down recovery hardware, loading data, and getting back online. A recovery plan should contain, as a minimum, the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>: Identifies the events, causes, or situations covered</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: The process to use for determining the extent of the damage and the appropriate actions for recovery</li>
<li><strong>Staging</strong>: The materials, equipment, staffing, and contingencies for the recovery actions appropriate to the damage</li>
<li><strong>Restoration</strong>: The detailed steps to restore, re-install, and recover systems, applications, and data</li>
<li><strong>Re-evaluate</strong>: A plan for the review and evaluation of the recovery and identification of any adjustments and improvements to the plan</li>
</ul>
<p>The first and primary goal in disaster recovery planning of any organization is to have a plan. The plan should be specific, but it should also be realistic and address only the disaster events that are possible in that particular location. For example, a plan for a company in Kansas probably doesn't need to include volcanic eruptions in its disaster recovery plan, while an organization in Hawaii probably doesn't need to cover a blizzard.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>A DRP may actually be several plans that share some or all of its stages. For example, a section of a disaster recovery plan on hurricanes will probably share some sections with heavy rainstorms or high winds. Whatever weather, war, or worse events the plan includes, each must be specific regarding the processes that are used to recover from it.</p>

<p>One of the first orders of business in disaster recovery is choosing a recovery site. For some organizations, disaster recovery may require more than one site, depending on the severity of the damage or priorities of the recovery plan. While there are some overlaps, there are essentially three levels of recovery sites, each characterized by its requirements and responsiveness. Recovery sites are either hot, warm, or cold sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hot site</strong>: This type of recovery site is essentially a copy of a production system and its environment, in some cases right down to the office furniture. The purpose of a hot site is to provide a failover safety net for a destroyed or incapacitated computing environment. The systems of a hot site operate concurrently with the production systems so that minimal downtime happens in the switch-over. The location of a hot site must consider the threats that may make it necessary. Disaster events may require the hot site to be in a geographically distant location.</li>
<li><strong>Warm site</strong>: This type of recovery site contains the necessary equipment and environments to support the essential components of a production system. However, the installation of up-to-date data and systems must occur before processing can begin. A warm site is appropriate when the loss of computing operations is not an emergency, such as administrative systems.</li>
<li><strong>Cold site</strong>: This type of recovery site is essentially an office space with the necessary environmental and power systems to support the restoration of computing services. Obviously, a cold site supports recovery actions that aren't emergencies on any level. In many cases, a cold site becomes a temporary operations center until the restoration or relocation of the main facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The strategy of the type of recovery site an organization includes in its disaster recovery plan depends on its business continuity needs, which are dependent on the mission, objectives, products, and services of the organization.</p>

<p>Catastrophic events rarely provide a warning in advance. This is why any organization should have a formal, written plan to continue its operations during or after a catastrophic event. Having such a plan can help an organization remain viable and stay in business. A BCP outlines the objectives, procedures, and step-by-step actions required to restart or continue an organization's as-normal-as-possible operations after a disruptive event. A BCP is different from a <strong>disaster recovery plan</strong> (<strong>DRP</strong>). A DRP focuses on the restoration of the computing infrastructure and its associated services. On the other hand, a BCP, which encompasses the DRP, takes a broader look at the business and the restoration or continuity of the functions of the entire organization, including its operational processes, equipment, staffing, and inventory.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the components of a BCP:</p>

<p>Several examples, templates, and best practices are available on the web for preparing a BCP, but there isn't a universally accepted standard format with a list of required contents. However, in any form, the BCP focuses on getting the business up and running again. In most cases, the first phase of the development of a BCP is the performance of a <strong>business impact analysis</strong> (<strong>BIA</strong>).</p>

<p>BIA takes a close look at an organization and projects the potential financial impact of any interruption in its operations from an extreme event. A BIA should identify how disruptive and destructive events could impact an organization. A BIA identifies what is likely to be affected by different events and severity levels. The following table shows one example of a BIA (with fictitious data, of course):</p>

<p>In general, a BIA project involves four phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gathering</strong>: This phase collects information from all sources concerning vulnerabilities, threats, loss, and recovery</li>
<li><strong>Evaluating</strong>: This phase evaluates the collected information for priority, degree of loss, and importance to business operations</li>
<li><strong>Documenting</strong>: A summary report of the information collected, the analysis process, and the conclusions of the impact analysis</li>
<li><strong>Presenting</strong>: The report is presented to senior management and stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<p>Another step in the development of a business continuity plan is risk assessment, which is generally a more detailed version of a BIA. With the approval of senior management and the stakeholders of the affected areas included in the BIA report and the events and results included, a risk assessment is the next step in this process. In smaller organizations, the BIA may include the results that a risk assessment would develop. However, in larger organizations, the events and threats of the BIA are expanded to identify what may be the specific assets or services that are lost in each case.</p>
<p>As its name implies, the purpose of risk assessment is to project which assets (equipment, people, tools, inventory, and so on) are at risk of loss or damage in an extreme event. Using the results of the risk assessment, a mitigation plan may be developed to remove or reduce the exposure of any identified vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The immediate focus of virtually all organizations that suffer some form of catastrophic damage that causes an interruption to its operations is to restore its infrastructure to the point that it can resume providing its products or services. There is no standard or <em>cookie-cutter</em> way for any organization to follow in order to restore its operations. Each organization is relatively unique in its structure, operational procedures, and the services required for a desired level of functionality.</p>
<p>Effective and efficient recovery from a disaster, whether it be natural or human-caused, requires pre-planning. In the aftermath of a destructive catastrophe, there will be very little in the way of <em>clear thinking</em> or <em>rational actions</em>. Having a plan to follow, even one that's slightly out of date, is certainly better than no plan at all. In the following sections, we will discuss the plans that any business (yes, even those with only one person who performs all its duties) should consider developing.</p>

<p>While some forms of catastrophe that could cause destruction to computing resources may or may not happen, others might. If an organization chooses to disregard the potential damage that could occur, they do so at their own peril, to turn a phrase. So, <em>what kind of damage could be so bad that an organization may lose its capability to continue its business operations?</em> During a heavy rainstorm, a roof leaks a steady drip directly on a business' only computer, which is powered up and unattended. Eventually, its power supply, motherboard, and internal components short out, effectively destroying the business' data and the capability to recover it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, hurricane his/her-name completely wipes out the data center for a large metropolitan hospital. The data and systems are available on backups, both physical and in the cloud, but the recovery requires computer hardware to provide continuity of the hospital's operations. The availability and location of a computer system that is capable of adequately supporting the hospital's systems at a moment's notice will definitely solve the hospital's immediate problem, provided such a system exists nearby.</p>

<p>Backup and replication are two data integrity and recovery methods that are frequently used interchangeably. However, they are actually quite different. A backup copy of data is just that, a copy. A backup is written to removable media and stored in an offsite location, physically or in the cloud. A replication is also a data copy process. However, replicated data has been copied for the purpose of storing copies of the data on distributed locations within an organization or on a subscribed cloud service.</p>
<p>A backup is generally created on a periodic basis, such as daily, weekly, or over longer periods. Replication is typically done online, in real-time or near-real-time. Restoring a backup can take some time if it must be retrieved from a remote storage facility, downloaded from the cloud, and then restored to a system. Restoring replicated data is immediately available, and the time involved amounts to not much more than its transmission time.</p>
<p>As of a disaster recovery plan, or as the core of a data integrity strategy, a data replication procedure ensures that the loss of one backup or copy of an organization's electronic data doesn't mean all is lost.</p>

<p>Data replication has several definitions and objectives, depending on how it's applied and its purpose. In one usage, data replication refers to a database being continuously updated so that two or more copies of the database are available in separate locations for processing. The purpose of data replication is to provide for coherent processing at distributed locations or to keep the data on the current hot site.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The two primary types of data replication are <strong>synchronous</strong> and <strong>asynchronous</strong>. Synchronous replication simultaneously writes to two storage devices, which guarantees a real-time distributed data source or a hot failover backup. Typically, the synchronization is a one-way process, as shown in the following diagram. This illustration shows the following steps in this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The host server writes to a primary storage (<strong>hard disk drive</strong> (<strong>HDD</strong>), <strong>network-attached storage</strong> (<strong>NAS</strong>), <strong>storage area network</strong> (<strong>SAN</strong>)).</li>
<li>The primary storage writes to the secondary storage.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>The secondary storage acknowledges the receipt of the record to the primary storage device.</li>
<li>The primary storage sends an acknowledgement back to the host server. The storage devices in a synchronous replication system can be separated over a distance, but the distance between the storage devices may be limited by the latency that the distance introduces:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1052 image-border" src="Images/c2ffdbe8-6748-4211-a64a-480d45748b03.jpg" style="width:29.83em;height:16.00em;" width="802" height="430"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The process steps of a synchronous replication system</div>
<p>Asynchronous replication is a more commonly used approach for replication over a distance and is a primary part of a disaster recovery strategy. Where latency is an issue in the synchronization of the two data storage devices, asynchronous replication ignores the latency by buffering disk storage data actions. Typically, the secondary storage operates a few actions behind the primary storage. Operationally, the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replications is the sequence of the replication events.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the process steps of asynchronous replication. This illustration shows the following steps in this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The host server writes to the primary storage device</li>
<li>The primary storage device acknowledges the action</li>
<li>The primary storage unit writes the record to the secondary storage device</li>
<li><span>The secondary storage device then</span> acknowledges the action:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1054 image-border" src="Images/5d432fc2-c4b8-48a7-a8bc-c815933c5a86.jpg" style="width:32.08em;height:16.58em;" width="798" height="413"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The process steps of an asynchronous replication system</div>
<p>An emerging replication method is near-synchronous replication. Near-synchronous replication only copies data changes to a secondary storage unit, typically with a latency of only a few seconds. Because near-synchronous replication writes each data change directly to the redundant site, the primary system can continue its processing without waiting for an acknowledgement from the secondary storage unit.</p>

<p>Several source-to-target variations exist for data replication, but the primary methods are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk-to-disk</strong>: This replication method copies data from one data storage device to another. In some ways, this form of replication can essentially be a backup strategy, but data replication between two storage devices is a real-time or near-real-time process.</li>
<li><strong>Server-based</strong>: This form of replication is generally an element of a high availability or disaster recovery strategy. Server-based replication systems can be any of the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Server-to-self</strong>: One disk volume replicates to another volume on the same server.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster-to-cluster</strong>: One disk cluster replaces to another disk cluster in a failover setup.</li>
<li><strong>Server-to-server</strong>: This form of replication operates as synchronous or asynchronous, as discussed previously. This form of replication is also referred to as site-to-site.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we discussed earlier, a data backup is a copy of some or all of the data on a secondary storage that is written to removable media and securely stored in an offsite physical or logical location. However, in practice, there are several methodologies to follow, each of which can be a part of the backup strategy of virtually any organization.</p>

<p>Backup software and utilities, for the most part, use the archive bit of a file to determine whether the file is to be written to the backup medium. While an archive bit set to <em>on</em> indicates that a file should be archived, not all backup methods set the archive bit to <em>off</em> after copying a file to the backup medium. The following section includes information on how each backup method deals with the archive bit.  </p>

<p>Data backups may be created in a variety of scopes and frequencies. The backup methods you will encounter on the Server+ exam are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full backup</strong> <strong>(normal backup)</strong>: This backup method copies all of the content stored on a secondary storage device and writes it—in compressed form, typically, to a removable medium for storage and archival purposes. Full backups are automatically taken on preset intervals, usually weekly, monthly, or at the end of a financial reporting period. Full backups turn off the archive bit.</li>
<li><strong>Copy backup</strong>: This backup method is used to create an archival copy of all or part of the data that's stored on secondary storage. A copy backup is just a copy of the data and does not affect the archive bit in any way.</li>
<li><strong>Incremental backup</strong>: This backup method copies only those files that have been modified or created since the last full or incremental backup. This means that only the files flagged with an <em>on</em> archive bit are captured. Typically, incremental backups are taken daily between full backups. However, to restore a system, you require the last full backup and each of the incremental backups since the last full backup must be reloaded. An incremental backup resets the archive bits to <em>off</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Differential backup</strong>: This backup method copies the files that have been modified or created since the last full backup. Each of the differential backups between full backups captures an accumulation of the data changes flagged by an <em>on</em> archive bit. However, a differential backup doesn't reset the archive bit, leaving that to the next full backup. To recover a system, only the last full backup and the last differential backup need be restored.</li>
<li><strong>Snapshot</strong>: A snapshot (an image) is a capture of the state of a system at one specific point in time. On a server, disk array, or a virtual machine, a storage snapshot is a variant backup that contains the information required to restore data back to the recovery point (the time at which the snapshot was taken). A snapshot file, like the one in the <strong>After Snapshot</strong> image in the following diagram, doesn't contain a copy of the data. Rather, it contains the locations of the data and its organization:</li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">These two images illustrate the before and after structure of a data filesystem snapshot</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selective backup</strong> <strong>(partial backup)</strong>: This backup method requires the administrator to pre-select, list, or mark the files, folders, and so on that are to be captured in the backup. Only the files and folders listed or marked are captured to the backup medium.</li>
<li><strong>Bare metal backup</strong>: Although we have discussed full backups and other methods for storage backups, this method of backup literally captures everything on a system, including the OS, stored application, and system software and data. The purpose for and the source of its name, a bare-metal backup is used to load the entire system to a bare metal computer.</li>
<li><strong>Open file backup</strong>: When a system backup is taken, it's ideal to have no running jobs (other than the backup system) on the computer. While this isn't always possible, there should be no open files on the system. In some cases, neither is possible. There is a variety of add-in software products that include the capability to capture open files to the backup medium. Nearly all of the software products for Windows require the <strong>Volume Shadow Copy Service</strong> (<strong>VSS</strong>) to be enabled. Several backup software packages for Linux will also capture open files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should it ever be necessary to restore some or all of a system from a backup medium, there are actually two types of restore processes—data restore, and OS or system restore. As their names imply, a data restore reloads all or some of the data on a backup medium and an OS restore reloads or resets the operating system and its settings back to their original states.</p>
<p>You should use a data restore procedure when some or all of the data on a secondary storage device is corrupted, erased, or compromised to reload specific files, an entire volume, or the entire data contents. An OS restore can restore a feature that's been removed erroneously or reset the system software back to a certain release.</p>

<p>Just about any magnetic medium may be used as a backup storage medium, but for the most part, the three general medium categories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear access</strong>: There is really only one type of linear access storage medium – magnetic tape. Linear access refers to the fact that accessing a magnetic tape is always beginning to end, front to back, serial access. Magnetic tape or <strong>linear tape-open</strong> (<strong>LTO</strong>) is perhaps the most commonly used medium for storing backup data. The current standard, LTO-6, provides 2.5 TB data storage, but with a higher data compression, an LTO-6 tape cartridge can hold as much as 6.25 TB. Tape is the less costly of the standard backup media and is also the easiest to store.</li>
<li><strong>Random access</strong>: In many cases, archiving data and backing up data are two different functions, although both create copies of data and files. Tape backup is better suited for archiving data, which requires longer term storage and is generally restored on the whole. Magnetic disks or <strong>solid-state drive</strong> (<strong>SSD</strong>), which are typically external peripherals, are much better for backing up data that may need to be restored in the near future, especially if only some of the backup's contents are to be accessed.</li>
<li><strong>Removable media</strong>: Unless an NAS or SAN is set aside for storing replicated or backed-up data, the medium that's used for storing the data is a form of removable media. Magnetic tape, external hard disk drives, external solid stage drives, optical media (CD-ROM, DVD, Blue-ray, <span><strong>write once, read many</strong> (</span><strong>WORM</strong>), and more), and USB-connected flash memory devices are all forms of removable media that can hold archived, backed up, or replicated data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of the type of storage media used to back up a system on any backup type, there are two calculations that an organization must consider in choosing a storage location for the backup media:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovery time objective (RTO)</strong>: RTO indicates the desired length of time it takes to recover a failed system. If the backup or replicated data is to be restored in the event of a catastrophic system failure, regardless of the cause, the off-site location of the archive media is a major consideration. If the site is located far from the recovery site, the RTO will need to be longer. However, if the storage site is close to the recovery site, a shorter RTO is possible.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery point objective (RPO)</strong>: RPO is the target point-in-time to be reestablished through data recovery for a failed system, for example, if a disaster recovery calls for the RPO to be no more than two days before the event that caused the need for a recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>With RTO and RPO guiding the choice of a storage location for the backup or replication media, the other issues, perhaps just as important, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access</strong>: The storage location, regardless of being physical or logical, must be accessible when it is necessary to restore the system. If the location is only open during the day, it could pose a problem if the system crashes during the night. The same considerations apply to a cloud storage location, but who has access, how access is effected, and what is accessible, should be consistent with the needs of the DRP.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: How well-secured the storage location is should be a major concern when choosing a site. A physical storage location must have the security devices and procedures that are in line with the criticality of the data being stored. A cloud storage service should provide information on its physical and logical security, which includes their procedures, should a security event occur.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental</strong>: A storage site may be accessible and secure, but if it is dusty, extremely hot or cold, and physically or structurally unsafe or dangerous, it's most likely not a good choice for storing your backups. The site (physical or logical) should have adequate air conditioning, air filtration, and monitoring to prevent damage to the storage media and its magnetic contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>A backup medium unit needs two actions to verify its integrity and restorability. The first element is identity. The label on a backup storage unit should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data stored on the medium, listed as specifically as needed, to locate particular data for restoration. The unit label must be more than <em>daily backup</em>.</li>
<li>The day, date, and time the data was written to the medium. If multiple units are involved, a sequence number of the set should be included using a <em>Unit n of x</em> units format.</li>
<li>The identity of the person who created the backup or replication.</li>
<li>Any other information pertinent to identifying the contents, security, or retention, as per the organization's standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second verification and integrity procedures should include procedures to test the integrity of the data on the backup and its restorability. Many data backup or replication software packages include the capability to calculate and store a <strong>cyclical redundancy check</strong> (<strong>CRC</strong>) on the tape that can be verified at a later date to test the integrity of the data on the medium. In addition, on a rotating basis, test restores should be performed on a non-production system or the recovery site system.</p>

<p>There are several backup data storage media retention and rotation strategies, most of which are based on the confidentiality or sensitivity of the data and its RTO/RPO metrics. However, the <strong>3-2-1 backup strategy</strong> is perhaps the basis for most backup plans. A 3-2-1 backup strategy requires that three copies of backup or replication data be created. Two of the copies, which are written to different mediums (such as one on tape and one in the cloud), are retained locally and one or more copies are kept offsite.</p>
<p>Many backup strategies also include a rotation schedule that recycles the backup medium after a certain period of time. For example, the medium of a backup created on Monday may be used again in three days, or perhaps after two weeks. A rotating medium helps to reduce cost and storage requirements.</p>

<p>An organization should have a formal, written plan that details the actions required to restart or continue operations after a disruptive event. A BCP details the restoration or continuity of the organization's processes, equipment, staffing, inventory, and so on. There's more to what goes into a fully formed DRP that just nailing down recovery hardware, loading data, and getting back online. A DRP focuses on the restoration of the computing infrastructure and its associated services and should include its scope statement, evaluation of the damage, a staging plan for each damage level, a restoration procedure, and a review of the plan's effectiveness. An important part of a DRP is the designation of a recovery site, which are classified as hot, warm, and cold sites.</p>
<p>A BIA projects the potential impact of an operational interruption from an extreme event by identifying the effect of different events and severity levels. A BIA project has four phases: gathering, evaluating, documenting, and presenting. A risk assessment identifies the events and threats, as well as the specific assets or services that would be lost in each case.</p>
<p>A backup is written to removable media and stored in an offsite location, physically or in the cloud. A replication stores a copy of data on a distributed location separately from the system. A backup is created on a periodic basis. Replication is an online, real-time duplicate of a primary data store. Data replication is synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous simultaneously writes to two storage devices. Asynchronous is an approach that's used for replication over a distance. Latency is an issue regarding synchronous replication, but not with asynchronous replication. Some replication methods include disk-to-disk, server-based, server-to-self, cluster-to-cluster, and server-to-server, while some data backup methods include full, copy, incremental, differential, and snapshot. The general backup mediums are linear access, random access, and removable media.</p>
<p>The calculations that can determine the location of a data storage medium are RTO and RPO. The backup medium needs to verify its integrity and restorability. Its identification label should include the data on the medium, the date and time of the backup, and who created the backup. Most backup retention strategies are based on the 3-2-1 strategy.</p>
