The goal of CoreOS has been to create a secure and reliable cluster OS and make it easier to develop distributed applications using Containers. CoreOS's philosophy has been to keep the kernel to a bare minimum while keeping it secure, reliable, and updated. Everything on top of the kernel runs as Containers, except a few critical services. Containers have revolutionized application development as well as application deployment. Even though Containers existed for a long time, Docker revolutionized the Container technology by making it easier to consume and distribute Containers.</p><p class="calibre_8">By making critical components of their technologies open source, CoreOS has created a major following in the CoreOS community as well as the general Linux and cloud communities. With Tectonic, CoreOS has combined all its open source technologies along with Kubernetes into one commercial offering. Cluster OS, Containers, and distributed application deployment are all pretty new and there is a lot of development happening in these areas. CoreOS is at a sweet spot, and this will encourage you to understand more about it.</p><p class="calibre_8">This book will cover CoreOS internals and the technologies surrounding the deployment of Container-based microservices in a CoreOS cluster.</p><p class="calibre_8">This book starts off with an overview of CoreOS and distributed application development and the related technologies around it. You will initially learn about installing CoreOS in different environments and using the CoreOS automatic update service. Next, critical CoreOS services to manage and interconnect services are covered along with networking and storage considerations. After this, the Container ecosystem, including Docker and Rkt, are covered along with Container orchestration. This book also covers how popular orchestration solutions such as OpenStack, the AWS Container service, and the Google Container engine integrate with CoreOS and Docker. Lastly, the book covers troubleshooting and production considerations for Containers, CoreOS, and distributed application development and deployment.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_12"/>
