<p>This part of this book covers the physical and logical security concepts, procedures, and devices you may encounter on the Server+ certification exam. The security and safety that's necessary to protect a network server and its immediate and remote connections involves systems that are dedicated to security; security protocols, security devices, and practices to physically protect data and equipment; and, of course, the various data protection technologies, such as encryption, which are used to secure data in use, in storage, and in transit.</p>
<p>There is certainly no part or configuration of a server that's more important than its security. Any security settings, configuration, or procedures must protect against external and internal intrusion, data corruption, and damage that's caused by malware. The objective of any computing network's security program is the CIA triad, which consists of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll look at the devices, software, methods, and protocols that can be combined to create a security system to protect a network server, its data, and its major systems. The following topics will be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security zones</li>
<li>Authentication protocols</li>
<li>Port security</li>
</ul>

<p>Gateway security devices, such as firewalls, define security zones to apply security policies to incoming and outgoing network traffic. To put this in a different way, a <strong>security zone</strong> is a logical structure that's created from one or more device ports/interfaces that apply the same security policies. A security zone can be just one interface, or it can include several interfaces if the interfaces apply the same policies. Each interface may also be a security zone, and a security zone may also include two or more interfaces. However, an interface can belong to only one security zone.</p>

<p>Many firewalls (hardware or software) predefine a set of security zones to facilitate initial configuration. Most installations require additional security zones, but for some the presets, just one security zone may be enough. The most common predefined security zones include the following:</p>
<div>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Security zone</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>LAN</p>

<td>
<p>Highest level of trust; includes VLANs</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>VPN/SSLVPN</p>

<td>
<p>Highest external level of trust; encrypted VPN traffic</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Untrusted</p>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>The security zones that are listed in the previous table can be either private or public security zones. The first two zones (LAN and VPN) are private security zones and the remaining zones are public zones.</p>
<p>The configuration of a security zone applies two primary policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security policies</strong>: These are rules that control the permit or deny inbound and outbound traffic based on the source and destination addresses, protocols, port numbers, and content</li>
<li><strong>Access control policies</strong>: These define who or what has permission to gain access to the resources behind a firewall</li>
</ul>

<p>On a local network, as well as on individual workstations, security policies can be set through a web browser. For example, the Microsoft <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> (<strong>IE</strong>) browser provides settings to restrict access to one or more predefined security zones, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Firewalls and other devices that perform intrusion detection and prevention are key security devices. In addition, each of these devices can be either a hardware appliance or a standalone or add-in software. In addition, a firewall can also be either <strong>host-based</strong> or <strong>network-based</strong>. Each has its advantages, but their applications are very different:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host-based</strong>: This type of firewall or security device is most common, as either software or hardware, on a network-connected host. The host can be a network node or a server, including a proxy server, that permits or denies message traffic that is either inbound or outbound. Host-based devices are more customized to the needs of smaller networks.</li>
<li><strong>Network-based</strong>: This is the type of firewall or intrusion security device most people envision: a security filtering device that permits or denies inbound traffic. A network firewall, an intrusion detection system, or an intrusion prevention system are examples of network-based security devices. Network-based devices, because they provide protection over a broader system, are, as the name implies, better suited to network-wide protection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Firewalls, regardless of their location in a network, are essentially just firewalls. However, intrusion detection and prevention systems commonly carry their placement in a network as part of their device names. A host-based intrusion detection system is an HIDS and a network-based system <span>intrusion detection system</span> is an NIDS.</p>

<p>The first part of the AAA procedure is authentication (followed by authorization and accounting), and attempts to verify that the user who's attempting to gain access has provided verifiable credentials or biometric evidence that they are who they say they are. In other words, all is well, if the password and username provided is in the list of good identifying data.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>This may not be the most sophisticated level of security for all situations, but it's the most commonly used method for authenticating a user. A variety of protocols that use similar methods perform authentication. In the following sections, we'll look at the most common authentication protocols.</p>

<p>Authentication uses input data or images that are provided by a user to verify that the data or image is a match to the data or images stored in advance for that specific user. The most common of these input values include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Password</strong>: This is the most common form of authentication input that's combined with a username, word, phrase, token, card, or other identification to verify the person providing the data as an authenticated user.</li>
<li><strong>One-time password</strong>: As its name states, you use a one-time password just once. A one-time password can be either a challenge-response password or a password from a predefined password list. A challenge-response password generates a value that the user calculates into a response value or looks up a response in a table. A password list contains values that are entered once for authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Public-key</strong>: Two pass keys, one private and one public, encrypt, decrypt, and verify the data that's been provided for authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-knowledge</strong>: Users receive a question or mathematical problem to answer or resolve that's unique each time. The CAPTCHA authentication method is an example of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated previously, an authentication protocol verifies that the identification data provided by a user is valid. More importantly, this procedure is the first line of security defense for an open and accessible network. Authentication protocols can be separated into two groups—<strong>point-to-point protocol</strong> (<strong>PPP</strong>) and AAA.</p>
<p>The following sections describe the most commonly used authentication protocols, with no order implied.</p>

<p>This category of authentication protocols is a common form of identifying a user requesting access to a system or network. The client is in direct communication with the authentication server and enters an identity phrase, word, or value and a password. If the server can verify this information, the user gains access. The authentication protocols that are included in this category are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</strong>: This is a legacy protocol that performs the absolute most basic authentication steps—a user's username and password go to an authentication server. If the server finds these values in its password tables, it sends an acceptance (permission to enter) message back. Because the transmissions between the client and server are in the clear, PAP isn't a secure choice.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)</strong>: After receiving a connection signal, the CHAP server (authenticator) transmits its hostname and a randomly generated data string (challenge) to the requesting client. The client then, using the challenge value, determines a corresponding secret value. The server then receives a bundle of data, including the secret value, the original challenge value—both encrypted with a one-way hash—and the client's hostname. The server duplicates the process that's performed by the client. If the result is the same as what was provided by the client, the client gains access. In addition, the CHAP handshake process may repeat periodically to reestablish its secure connection.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)</strong>: EAP is a general protocol that combines with different authentication methods, including Kerberos, one-time passwords, digital certifications, smart cards, PKI, and others. EAP versions support both wired and wireless LANs. The difference between EAP and the other APs is that EAP essentially acts as middleware between the client and an authentication server, such as RADIUS. The various versions of EAP include EAP-TLS, EAP-FAST, PEAP, and LEAP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>triple-A</em> (AAA) protocols provide the mechanisms to enforce, regulate, and monitor user access to a system or network. Authentication enforces who has access. Authorization regulates what a user may do, while accounting keeps track of what each authenticated and authorized user did. The most common of the AAA protocols include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kerberos</strong>: Although not nearly as fierce as its namesake, Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades, Kerberos is a secure authentication protocol. Kerberos uses what it calls a <em>ticket</em>, which is an encrypted proof of identity to identify a user or a local network node. Kerberos authenticates a user to multiple systems rather than to a single system.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</strong>: An open standard for directory services, LDAP is common in authentication processes for storing and verifying user accounts. LDAP maintains a database (directory tree) of user credentials. Users attempting to log into a system or network enter their credentials and LDAP searches its tree. If LDAP finds the credentials, the user gains access.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)</strong>: This authentication protocol provides centralized network access control, although, in most cases, not through a dial-in service. When a user attempts to log into a system, his or her credentials go to the RADIUS server in an access-request message. The RADIUS server, depending on whether the user's credentials are valid, responds with an <strong>Access-Accept</strong>, <strong>Access-Reject</strong>, or <strong>Access-Challenge</strong> message.</li>
<li><strong>Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS)</strong>: This is another legacy AAA protocol that, like RADIUS, forwards user credentials to an authentication server for verification and permission to gain access to a system or network. A newer version, <strong>Extended TACACS</strong> (<strong>XTACACS</strong>), includes authorization and accounting. Neither version should be confused with TACACS+, which is a totally different protocol.</li>
<li><strong>TACACS+</strong>: This is a version of TACACS that was developed by Cisco systems and encrypts its packets entirely before forwarding them to an authentication server. TACACS+ transmits on TCP, while TACACS/XTACACS use UDP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The SSL and the TLS, which is an updated version of the SSL, secures TCP communications, especially for HTTP messages.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the handshake process between a client and server using the SSL/TLS protocol:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a1c18992-570f-4f20-abc8-08c860180b9e.jpg" style="width:29.92em;height:24.25em;" width="801" height="650"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"> The steps in the SSL/TLS handshake</div>
<p>Let's go through the steps of this handshake process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step A</strong>: The client sends a <em>Hello</em> message to the target server. This message includes the version of SSL or TLS the client is using and the client's preferences for encryption algorithms (cipher suite), a compression method, and a random string value for use in computations.</li>
<li><strong>Step B</strong>: If all goes well, the server responds with its <em>Hello</em> message, which contains the server's choice for the cipher suite (from the client's list), a session ID, and its own random string value. The server then provides a digital certificate to the client. The server may request a certificate from the client.</li>
<li><strong>Step C</strong>: The client verifies the server's certificate. If verified, it sends the random string value, encrypted with the server's public key, to the server. This value will generate the encryption key for any subsequent messages.</li>
<li><strong>Step D</strong>: After exchanging encrypted <em>finished</em> messages to signal the end of the handshake's creation, the client and server transmit data and messages that have been encrypted with the shared key.</li>

<p>The IPSec defines a series of standards for both the encryption and transmission integrity of OSI network layer packets that are transmitted with transport layer protocols. IPSec uses tunneling protocols to securely transmit data on a network and to prevent corruption of the data while in transit.</p>
<p>Security policies defining the security requirements of the network define IPSec functions. Each security policy defines a filter. These filters relate to the sources or destination IP addresses, transport layer port numbers, or the encapsulating protocol of a packet. When the data in a packet matches that of a filter, the filter's action applies.</p>

<p>An IPSec policy contains rules and filters, which define the what, when, and how of securing transmitted network traffic. Rules and filters relate to specific types of network traffic and the level of security is required.</p>
<p>The functions and actions of an IPSec system are set through the rules that it's been configured to follow. Windows operating systems contain a set of example security rules, but these rules are strictly examples. They really don't provide much in the way of actual security. IPSec rules specifically define the domain to which it applies and whether it's in transport or tunnel mode (more on that later).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following screenshot shows the dialog box being used to define a new security rule:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1209 image-border" src="Images/98a1466b-faaa-4156-a446-aa2886377aac.jpg" style="width:66.67em;height:35.17em;" width="1042" height="780"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Defining a new IPSec policy rule on a Windows OS</div>
<p>IPSec policy rules may consist of one or more filters (so-called because they effectively perform packet filtering). Each filter may include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filter list</strong>: This is a list of the incoming or outgoing network messages on which the filter is to apply its filter actions.</li>
<li><strong>Filter action</strong>: A filter has three basic functions it can apply to a message—<strong>permit</strong>, <strong>block</strong>, or <strong>negotiate</strong> security. The actions of permit and block should be self-explanatory. The negotiate security filter action applies IKE to determine the security mode (<span><strong>Authentication Header</strong> (</span><strong>AH</strong>) or <strong><span>Encapsulatin</span>g Security Pa</strong><span><strong>yload</strong> (</span><strong>ESP</strong>)), the encryption method, and other session security data.</li>
<li><strong>Filter authentication methods</strong>: Kerberos, a CA certificate, or a pre-shared security key authenticate each endpoint in a security negotiation.</li>
<li><strong>Tunnel endpoints</strong>: If this value is present, it serves two purposes: an indication that tunneling protocols are in use and providing the IP address of one of the tunnel endpoints. Tunneling mode uses two filters, one for each end (and direction) of the tunnel.</li>
<li><strong>Connection type</strong>: This is an indicator of the type of connection to which a filter applies, which can be a LAN, a remote connection (VPN), or both.</li>
<li><strong>Default response rule</strong>: If one of the endpoints in an IPSec session doesn't have a security rule defined, the default response rule provides the missing filter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The filter action applies when the filter list, and possibly other rules, matches the corresponding data in a packet, such as its IP addresses, port number, and protocol.</p>

<p>IPSec can operate in two primary modes—<strong>transport</strong> mode or <strong>tunnel</strong> mode. In transport mode, which is IPSec's default mode, message security is end-to-end between a network client and a network server through two methods—<strong>payload encryption</strong> or <strong>secure communications</strong>. IPSec may operate in either of these configurations using one of the following modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AH transport mode</strong>: As its name suggests, AH mode inserts a header into each packet, which contains a keyed hash total to ensure the packet's integrity. AH mode doesn't encrypt packets by default, but local administration may provide custom data checking and encryption rules.</li>
<li><strong>ESP transport mode</strong>: ESP mode essentially includes the message actions of the AH mode with the addition of the encryption of the payload (data) portion of the message only:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1060 image-border" src="Images/29aa3b91-0ec4-4084-99aa-80c9f6cf7bb0.jpg" style="width:28.67em;height:11.67em;" width="966" height="394"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"> A comparison of the AH and ESP message formats</div>
<p>The preceding diagram shows the packet formats of the IPSec transport modes. As we can see, the primary differences are that ESP encrypts the original message and appends additional information to the packet for authentication and integrity checking.</p>
<p>Each transport mode has an associated tunnel mode. In either format, IPSec applies encryption to the entire message after it's formatted into either an AH or ESP transport mode packet. After encapsulating the encrypted message, an IP header with the IP addresses the source and destination endpoints of the IPSec tunnel.</p>
<p>As illustrated in the following diagram, AH tunnel mode places the AH header before the contents of the original packet. After encrypting this header and the packet's contents, AH adds an IP header with the associated IP addresses:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1061 image-border" src="Images/b70c2a56-7e55-47bf-9915-35f94baa321e.jpg" style="width:27.08em;height:12.08em;" width="732" height="326"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">AH protocol transport and tunnel mode message formats</div>
<p>Another operational mode of IPSec is the <strong>Internet Key Exchange</strong> (<strong>IKE</strong>), which can supervise the authentication, application of security policies and rules, and key exchange activities of each side of an IPSec interaction.</p>

<p>Many switches and routers have all of their interfaces enabled by default, right out of the box. As we've discussed, hardening—that is, closing unused ports—helps to secure a network by closing possible entry points. There are several approaches, standards, and methods used to secure internetworking devices, especially routers and switches, most of which are <strong>port-based network access control</strong> (<strong>PNAC</strong>) methods.</p>

<p>In general terms, port-based security secures the interfaces (ports) of a switch by limiting the number or specific devices that may forward packets or frames to one or more of its ports. Port security has two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic locking</strong>: This sets the maximum number of MAC addresses the device can <em>learn</em>. After reaching the limit, the device ignores any additional unknown MAC addresses and any messages from those devices.</li>
<li><strong>Static locking</strong>: The device forwards only the MAC addresses included in a manually configured static address list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also known as <em>dot1x</em>, IEEE 802.1x defines a PNAC standard that performs an authentication process before allowing access to a device interface port. IEEE 802.1X provides for authentication and encryption key management on IEEE 802 networks, both wired and wireless. 802.1x is based on the EAP and is applied through <strong>EAP over LAN</strong> (<strong>EAPoL</strong>) and the <strong>EAP over Wireless</strong> (<strong>EAPoW</strong>) protocols.</p>
<p>In the following diagram, in the 802.1x authentication process, the client software on the wireless workstations and the LAN workstations is the supplicant, the wireless AP and the LAN switch serve as authenticators, and the authentication server is, well, the authentication server:</p>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The IEEE 802.1x authentication process goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client software (supplicant) on a LAN workstation (wireless or wired) sends an EAPoL start packet to an interface port on an <strong>access point</strong> (<strong>AP</strong>) or switch.</li>
<li>The AP or switch (authenticator) replies with an EAPoL identity request.</li>
<li>The supplicant sends back its identity, which is typically a username or an identity code.</li>
<li>The authenticator forwards the supplicant's information to the authentication server (commonly a RADIUS or DIAMETER server).</li>
<li>The authentication server, after verifying the identity of the supplicant, sends the authentication method it prefers to the authenticator, which forwards it to the supplicant. The authentication methods that are supported in this standard include <strong>Tunneled Transport Layer Security</strong> (<strong>TTLS</strong>), <strong>Transport Layer Security</strong> (<strong>TLS</strong>), <strong>Message Digest version 5</strong> (<strong>MD5</strong>), <strong>Protected EAP</strong> (<strong>PEAP</strong>), and others.</li>
<li>The supplicant replies to the authentication server, through the authenticator, with its access credentials, such as a username and password or a digital certificate.</li>
<li>The authentication server verifies the information that's provided by the supplicants and either permits or denies access.</li>
</ol>

<p>An ACL is a filter that's applied by internetworking devices, especially routers, firewalls, and switches, to identify and permit or deny access to an internal network to incoming message traffic. For the most part, ACLs are associated with an interface port on a device, and is under the assumption that the message traffic entering that interface is definable by source, destination, protocol, or port number.</p>

<p>The objectives of the Server+ certification exam identifies router ACLs as something you will encounter on the exam. An ACL on a router performs the same basic function that we described in the previous section. However, router ACLs provide specific or targeted access to permit or deny filtering. A very common application for a router ACL is as part of an inbound DMZ, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1063 image-border" src="Images/d77bb3c6-0ecf-404f-ab5a-6a100f4c8164.jpg" style="width:27.08em;height:15.25em;" width="816" height="459"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">An ACL can be the controlling mechanism in a DMZ setup</div>
<p>A router with one or more strictly configured ACLs can, in many respects, serve as a firewall first and a router second. The firewall/router, based on the filters in its ACL, can direct any incoming messages with unknown or blocked data.</p>
<p>A network DMZ doesn't have to be a dead-end destination for denied messages. It's common for networks to route unknown source addresses and specific protocols to a DMZ. This may include a web server, remote access servers, and more.</p>

<p>Generally, ACLs from different router providers can have features or controls that vary from model to model. However, nearly all routers support the following ACL features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACL identification</strong>: In different routers, the identity of an ACL could be a name, a combination of alphanumeric characters, or a number, which could have significance in its value.</li>
<li><strong>Access Control Entry (ACE)</strong>: An ACL may have one or more ACEs, each of which identifies a specific set of conditions that determine whether the content of an incoming (or perhaps outgoing) message permits it to be passed, denied or redirected.</li>
<li><strong>Source and destination addresses</strong>: ACLs and ACEs determine Permit or Deny using a message's source or destination IP address. The ACL compares the message's addresses to those defined in an ACE, which may be a range of addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p>A standard ACL filters messages using only its source (originating) addresses. Standard ACLs are perhaps the simplest to use and create, but their simplicity also limits their effectiveness. An ACE in a standard ACL contains only the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access control list number</strong>: A standard ACL must have an ACL number of 1 through 99 (inclusive) or 1,300 through 1,999 (inclusive). These number ranges identify it as a standard ACL.</li>
<li><strong>Source IP address</strong>: This is the specific IP address or address range compared to the source IP address of an incoming message. If there's a match, the corresponding Permit or Deny action applies.</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard mask</strong>:  <span>ACL entries may include a wildcard mask that's used similarly to a subnet mask. More on </span>this in the <em>Wildcard masks</em> section later.</li>
<li><strong>Permit or deny</strong>: This is the action that's taken if the comparison of the source IP address against the address or address range is true.</li>

<p>An extended ACL provides the ability to filter message traffic using either or both the source and destination addresses, as well as a TCP/UDP port number. In other words, it extends the capabilities of the standard ACL. An ACE in an extended ACL may contain any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access control list number</strong>: Extended ACLs must have an ACL number of 100 through 199 (inclusive) or 2,000 through 2,699 (inclusive). These number ranges identify it as an extended ACL.</li>
<li><strong>Permit or Deny</strong>: This action is taken if the comparison of the message content against the ACE content is true.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: These protocols are <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>), <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (<strong>TCP</strong>), <strong>User Datagram Protocol</strong> (<strong>UDP</strong>), <strong>Internet Control Message Protocol</strong> (<strong>ICMP</strong>), <strong>Generic Routing Encapsulation</strong> (<strong>GRE</strong>), and <strong>Internet Gateway Routing Protocol</strong> (<strong>IGRP</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Source IP address</strong>: This is the public IP address from which the message originated.</li>
<li><strong>Source address mask</strong>: This is the subnet mask associated with the source IP address' network or subnet. </li>
<li><strong>Operator source port</strong>: This indicates the condition of the comparison test involving the port number and contains both the conditional operator and the port number. The conditional operator may be <strong>less than</strong> (<strong>lt</strong>), <strong>greater than</strong> (<strong>gt</strong>), <strong>equal</strong> (<strong>eq</strong>), or <strong>not equal</strong> (<strong>neg</strong>) and contains the TCP/UDP port number.</li>
<li><strong>Destination IP address</strong>: This is the public IP address of the receiver of the message.</li>
<li><strong>Destination address mask</strong>: <span>This is the subnet mask associated with the network or subnet of the  destination IP address. </span></li>
<li><strong>Operator destination port</strong>: This is the same as for the operator source port.</li>

<p>In addition to standard and extended ACLs, some routers also implement two other ACL types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethertype</strong>: This permits or denies Layer 2 (Ethernet) frames.</li>
<li><strong>Webtype</strong>: There are two different webtype ACLs—the URL-based ACL filters specific protocol and the URL combinations. The TCP-based ACL filters permit or deny specific IP addresses and TCP port numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Reflexive</strong>: This ACL type, that is, an IP session, creates a permitting inbound ACL for responses to outbound messages.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong>: This type of ACL, that is, lock-and-key, allows a user to access a specific source or destination IP address.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, ACLs also fall into one of two general types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discretionary ACL (DACL)</strong>: This type of ACL specifically identifies the IP addresses, user or group accounts, port numbers, and protocols with permission to access a resource</li>
<li><strong>System ACL (SACL)</strong>: This type of ACL controls the router feature that generates log or audit entries and details attempts to access a resource</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>As we've already discussed, an ACL consists of one or more ACEs. Each ACE has one of three general purposes, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access-denied ACE</strong>: An entry in a DACL that specifically denies access based on a requestor's information</li>
<li><strong>Access-allowed ACE</strong>: An entry in a DACL that specifically permits access based on a requestor's information</li>
<li><strong>System-audit ACE</strong>: An entry in a SACL that generates a tracking entry when a requestor attempts to access to a resource</li>
</ul>
<p>The testing and its resulting action of each ACE occur one entry at a time. It's almost as if no other entries are in the ACL. Each ACE has no relationship to any other ACE before or after it, other than where it is in the sequence of the ACL.</p>
<p>The sequence of the ACEs in an ACL is extremely important. The test conditions and their results should be logical and not contradictory. For example, if an ACE denies access to all messages from a certain IP address and later in the ACL another ACE permits only ICMP messages from that address, the deny ACE makes the permit ACE moot. After denying everything, there's nothing to permit. I bring this up not only to make a sequencing point, but to lead into the purposes of implicit and explicit deny actions.</p>
<p>An implicit anything is a result that occurs by default. An explicit anything is specific. Implicit is an assumption and explicit is a stated fact. For example, if a tour guide has a list of participants that can board the tour bus, not being on the list implicitly denies anyone else boarding. However, a competing tour company has a list of people who are absolutely barred from boarding their bus. In this case, being on the list explicitly denies participation.</p>
<p>Nearly all routers, firewalls, active directory servers, and other access control devices automatically include an implicit deny at the end of an ACL. This implicit deny functions to block any access requests that aren't included in the ACL, meaning that requests that have fallen through all of the ACEs in the ACL. An implicit deny as the last entry in an ACL says it denies any request that got that far.</p>
<p>An explicit deny can be anywhere in an ACL, depending on how specific it is. An explicit deny for a specific IP address should precede any general permit entry. An explicit deny at the end of an ACL is typically a <em>deny any</em> entry that functions exactly like the catchall implicit deny.</p>

<p>Also known as inverted masks, ACL IP address entries may include and apply a wildcard mask, which work much differently compared to the wildcard characters of the Windows world. In fact, ACL wildcard masks work essentially in the opposite way to subnetting masks.</p>
<p>In a subnet mask, the masking process only extracts the binary value positions that contain one value from an IP address. However, in an ACL wildcard mask, a binary zero indicates the address positions that must match. In other words, a zero bit in the mask means the corresponding bit in the message address must match (to create a true condition) and a one bit indicates an ignored bit position in the address.</p>
<p>For example, in a standard ACL entry, the source IP address and its wildcard mask appear (one after the other) as <kbd>162.29.5.12 0.0.0.0</kbd>. In this entry, <kbd>162.29.5.12</kbd> is the source IP address and <kbd>0.0.0.0</kbd> is the wildcard mask. The zeroes in the wildcard mask represent that each octet contains all zeroes. Otherwise, the wildcard mask would be <kbd>00000000.0000000.00000000.00000000</kbd>. Another way to represent the same setting is to use the <kbd>host2</kbd> <span> term </span>before the IP address: <kbd>host 162.29.5.12</kbd>.</p>
<p>The more common use of wildcard masks is in extended ACLs, where they identify entire or major subnets of a network. For example, if an ACL entry is to permit all addresses on a certain network, the one bits indicate the portion of the address that's permitted and the zeroes indicate the portion of the address that's ignored. If we wish to permit all of the nodes on the <kbd>210.20.158.0</kbd> network, the wildcard mask will be <kbd>0.0.0.255</kbd>. The <kbd>255</kbd> portion of the mask means that whatever host ID is in the fourth octet, permit it.</p>

<p>Essentially, the PKI is sort of like one of your close friends introducing you to some of their close friends. Officially, PKI is a suite of rules, guidelines, and policies that define, issue, manage, apply, store, and revoke digital certificates and the use of public key encryption. In simpler terms, PKI is an encryption and security methodology that provides better security for the identity of the correspondents and the content of the data than simpler methods, such as a password.</p>
<p>Practically, PKI is the coordinated interaction of its four parts, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certificate authority (CA)</strong>: A trusted organization that provides unique digital certificates to subscribers and manages public keys and identity credentials for the data encryption of stored data, websites, and email</li>
<li><strong>Registration authority (RA)</strong>: A network service that approves and forwards requests for identity verification (digital certificates) and the certificate authority that issues it</li>
<li><strong>Certificate request database</strong>: Stores requests for digital certificates</li>
<li><strong>Certificate store</strong>: Stores digital certificates</li>

<p>These are security protocols that provide data encryption and authentication for messages that are transmitted over a network. Their differences aren't large, but they are not interoperable. However, since TLS is the replacement for SSL, you will often see them listed as SSL/TLS.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Digital certificates aren't dependent on specific protocols. The protocols that are enabled on a system or network are the property of the system or network configuration and not the security certificates in use. For example, an SSL digital certificate doesn't require only the SSL protocol, and TLS digital certificates don't require only TLS. In fact, for the most part, certificate authorities refer to these certificates as SSL/TLS certificates.</p>

<p>A VPN creates an encrypted end-to-end connection over an insecure network, primarily over the internet. VPNs are common in companies for their remotely authorized users, such as remote branch office workers, to access central office applications and other resources.</p>
<p>A VPN connects two locations over a network using an encrypted tunneling protocol. In fact, a VPN encrypts the elements of both the private network and the public network that's used to complete the connection. The three primary protocol types that are used with VPNs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP Security (IPSec)</strong>: A set of security and encryption protocols for protecting IP packets that are transmitted over a network using either transport mode or tunneling mode</li>
<li><strong>Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)</strong>: A protocol for creating VPNs</li>
<li><strong>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)</strong>: A protocol that allows <strong>Internet Service Providers</strong> (<strong>ISPs</strong>) to provide VPNs to subscribers</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a VPN allows secured connections over a public network, a VLAN is a logical internal network configuration that can provide several benefits to users and administrators. A VLAN creates a group of network nodes into a logical network. This is a virtual network in that the included nodes may be on separate physical networks.</p>
<p>A VLAN can be one of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static VLAN</strong>: Also known as a port-based VLAN, it consists of one or more network switch interface ports that have been configured to a VLAN. Any device that's connected to a port that's been configured to a static VLAN is automatically on that VLAN.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic VLAN</strong>: The identification of a node in a dynamic VLAN is done by its physical address (MAC address) or network usernames. A <strong>VLAN Member Policy Server</strong> (<strong>VMPS</strong>) provides the list of nodes belonging to the dynamic VLANs and provide the configuration data to the effected network switches.</li>
</ul>

<p>A security zone is a logical structure that's created from one or more interfaces that apply the same security policies. Many firewalls predefine security zones, with the most common being LAN, VPN, DMZ, and WAN. A security zone applies security policies and access control policies.</p>
<p>Security devices, such as firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention devices, are either hardware or software. Security devices can be host-based or network-based. A host-based intrusion detection system is a HIDS and a network-based system is a NIDS.</p>
<p>An authentication protocol verifies the credentials that have been provided by a user are valid and serves as the first line of security defense for an open network. Authentication protocols are either PPP or AAA. The most common of the AAA protocols include Kerberos and IPSec. An IPSec policy defines rules and filters for specific types of network traffic and security levels. IPSec operates in transport mode or tunnel mode and within each in AH or ESP modes.</p>
<p>Port-based security has two approaches: dynamic locking and static locking. IEEE 802.1x PNAC performs authentication before allowing access to an interface. 802.1x is based on EAP.</p>
<p>An ACL permits or denies access to the network via incoming messages. ACLs are associated with interfaces and apply to messages using source and/or destination addresses, protocols, or port numbers. Router ACLs include ACL ID, ACE, and source and destination addresses. A standard ACL filters messages using source addresses. An extended ACL filters messages using source and destination addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers. The two general types are DACL and SACL.</p>
<p>Routers and other access control devices automatically include an implicit deny at the end of an ACL. An explicit deny can be anywhere in an ACL.</p>
<p>PKI is an encryption and security method that secures the source and receiver of a message or document. PKI has four parts—CA, RA, certificate request DB, and certificate store. PKI provides access control, authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.</p>
<p>A VPN creates an encrypted end-to-end connection over the internet using a tunneling protocol. The protocols that are used with VPNs are IPSec, PPTP, and L2TP. A VLAN is a logical network configuration that is either static or dynamic.</p>
