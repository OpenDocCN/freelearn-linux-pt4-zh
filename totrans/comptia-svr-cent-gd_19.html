<p>Although most computer problems are software-related and easy to resolve, hardware components can also have issues, which are usually at a minimum disruptive or, at the extreme, catastrophic. Your ability to troubleshoot, resolve, and document hardware issues directly impacts just how disruptive a hardware issue may be. In this chapter, we will look at PC hardware problems that occur relatively frequently. These problems are those that you are likely to see in your role as a certified server administrator.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common hardware problems and their causes</li>
<li>Environmental issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Hardware problems can be a fault in or related to an electrical or electronic component, or possibly the setup, installation, or configuration of a component, which leads to the malfunction or failure of an entire computer. However, what may appear to be a hardware problem can be a software-caused issue. At the risk of being obvious, a major difference between a hardware problem and a software problem is that a hardware problem typically requires you to open or remove the system case, as opposed to simply applying a patch.</p>

<p>Some computer problems are difficult to pin down as either software or hardware issues. While there are some that are just obvious, such as smoke coming out of the case, when it comes to others, you just can't tell. Some conditions that can help you identify a problem as an issue with hardware include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intermittent failure</strong>: A problem that occurs irregularly, but in the same way each time, can be either hardware or software-related. If this problem begins immediately (or soon thereafter) after the installation of new software or a patch or upgrade to an existing operating system or application, it's most likely a software issue. However, if the problem begins to occur in a period with no software changes, then you've guessed it—it's probably hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Access failure</strong>: If a problem occurs after any use of a component or an I/O operation on a peripheral device, it's very likely that the problem is with the failing hardware. However, there is a chance that the problem could be the result of a software flaw. You should eliminate this issue as a hardware problem before testing for a software problem.</li>
<li><strong>Random stopping or rebooting</strong>: If you're working away on what must be a very valuable document, thesis, dissertation, or game and the computer suddenly freezes up and shuts down or arbitrarily reboots itself, then you have a hardware problem.</li>
<li><strong>POST failure</strong>: A part of the startup (boot) process is the <strong>power-on self-test</strong> (<strong>POST</strong>) that verifies the presence and functionality of the devices that were identified in the BIOS/UEFI configuration settings. If the boot process fails, the POST displays error message or codes on the display or sounds a pattern of beeps (representing a specific error condition) on the system speaker. Obviously, this is a hardware issue and typically one that occurs right after the installation of new hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other symptoms that usually indicate a hardware issue are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BSoD/RSoD</strong>: The blue or red screen of death indicates an error between the operating system and the hardware configuration</li>
<li><strong>I/O</strong>: Reads and writes to secondary storage are very slow</li>
<li><strong>Data integrity</strong>: Files are inexplicably damaged, corrupted, or missing</li>
<li><strong>Muddled display</strong>: The display is missing parts of an image; the display is chaotic or not the expected image or content</li>
<li><strong>Unusual noises</strong>: Scraping, grinding, banging, and perhaps beeping noises emanating from the system case</li>
</ul>

<p>Most, but certainly not all, computer hardware problems are relatively easy to diagnose and, in many cases, simple to resolve. Otherwise, <em>why would a certification exam focused on network servers include troubleshooting and repair information?</em> As a system administrator, your skill set should include the ability to identify and resolve common hardware issues. The following sections identify failures for several hardware categories or components. Just so you know, each of these issues are very likely to appear on the certification exam in one form or another.</p>

                </header>

<p>As we discussed earlier, a failure during the POST phase of the boot process can cause the startup process to stop. Although POST communicates any problems it detects, the form of that communication varies among BIOS/UEFI versions. Both Windows PCs and macOS computers run a POST process as an initial part of the startup or boot process. The POST verifies the presence and functionality of essential components and devices, such as the <strong>power supply unit</strong> (<strong>PSU</strong>), main memory (RAM), and the system bus structure, among others. Should any of these devices not respond to the POST, a pattern of audible beep tones will sound out to alert the user.</p>
<p>While the POST is running, the only output device that's available is the system speaker. For this reason, POST uses a pattern of short or long beep sounds to indicate any problem it has found. These codes are generally unique to the manufacturer of the motherboard or computer. There is no standard set of beep codes and each manufacturer has its own unique set. So, a technician working in an environment with PCs from several manufacturers may need to be multi-beep savvy.</p>
<p>The following table is an example of the use of beep codes with some illustrations of their meanings. As indicated, beep tones are short and long. A short beep is typically one second long and a long beep is two seconds long:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Overheating</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A computer overheats for a variety of reasons, but generally, it's caused by neglected preventive maintenance. Dust building up on the air vents and grills and inside the system case can block or restrict the airflow that was designed to cool the heat-emitting components. Heat inside the system case that slowly rises above its safe operating limits can also slowly cause the electronic components on the motherboard and installed devices to deteriorate. The damage comes from a heat buildup caused by the dust creating an insulating layer and trapping heat that can't escape.</p>
<p>Another factor that can contribute to a computer's overheating problem is a combination of its location and the ventilation and airflow it has. A well-ventilated space provides a base environment that provides for the underlying conditions that are assumed in the engineering of the computer's cooling system. Other factors include direct sunlight, closeness to exterior windows, or furniture or objects obstructing the airflow.</p>
<p>The resolution for a computer with an overheating problem, either intermittent or persistent, is to basically reverse the conditions causing the computer to overheat. Clean the inside of the system case with compressed air to blow any layers of dust away from any cooling system vents, fans, heat sinks, and air passages. You can vacuum the dust, but make sure you're using a vacuum cleaner that doesn't create or emit static electricity. In other words, don't use your household vacuum!</p>
<p>If cleaning doesn't resolve the problem, check the location and its access to the ambient ventilation system. Moving the computer out of direct sunlight and away from anything blocking the airflow is your next step. And, if this doesn't solve the problem, you may have a malfunctioning case fan, the heat sink or CPU fan is wrong, or the thermal paste is too much or too little. You'll need to work through these issues one at a time to eliminate them as possible causes.</p>

                </header>

<p>If the microprocessor in a computer fails, it's a very good indication of some other problems—not that it matters at that point. There are only a few reasons why a processor would fail, such as an extreme power surge or lightning strike, bungled attempts to overclock the CPU, or the accumulated damage of overheating. Most processors now include a protection mechanism that slows down or halts it completely if its operating temperature rises too high. While this feature does protect the processor against sudden and significant temperature increases, over the long term, a processor, especially one that's heavily used, can slowly begin to fail.</p>
<p>Monitoring the temperature of the CPU on a new commercially assembled computer can set a reliable baseline. However, if you were to install a new CPU or cooling devices, any unnoticed misalignment or improper application could create a false baseline. Checking the system regularly against this baseline is essentially keeping track of the <strong>time to failure</strong> (<strong>TTF</strong>).</p>
<p>So, <em>how do you</em> <em>take the temperature of a CPU?</em> And <em>what should the</em> <em>temperature be?</em> It does vary a bit from processor to processor, but the rule of thumb is that a processor should normally operate in the range of 45<sup>o</sup> to 50<sup>o</sup> <strong>Celsius</strong> (<strong>C</strong>), which is 113<sup>o</sup> to 122<sup>o</sup><sup> </sup><strong>Fahrenheit</strong> (<strong>F</strong>). Under a full load, such as playing a game, the CPU should not exceed 750 C (167<sup>o</sup> F). Some processors can run at a higher temperature, but not for very long before damaging the CPU.</p>

<p>A computer, much like a human, cannot function very well after its memory starts to go. Memory-related errors and failures on a computer aren't necessarily obvious and, in most cases, seem to indicate that other components may be the problem. Common memory problems and issues include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gradual slowdown</strong>: When you first power up the computer, everything zips right along. However, as the day wears on, the computer gets slower and slower to the point that downloading a website or opening a document can take minutes, not seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Random restarts</strong>: As you are working, the computer restarts itself intermittently with a random amount of time in between or the computer locks up and the keyboard and mouse no longer seem to work.</li>
<li><strong>Corrupt files</strong>: While this often seems like a disk drive issue (and it could be), it could also be a memory issue. Commonly, memory failures can corrupt a single frequently-used file or filesystem to the point of rendering the disk drive unusable.</li>
<li><strong>Failed installations</strong>: When you are installing or reinstalling software, including an operating system or major application, the installation process halts, freezes, or displays a random error message that may not have anything to do with the actual problem, which is likely memory.</li>
<li><strong>BSoD/RSoD</strong>: The <strong>Blue Screen of Death</strong> (<strong>BSoD</strong>) or its cousin, red, flash up on the display quickly, telling you there's possibly a problem (usually memory), before continuing with the boot process.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part, the causes of memory problems are essentially the same as those that create problems for the CPU <span>– </span>heat, power surges, electrostatic damage, improper installation, overclocking the CPU, a damaged memory module slot, or a fault in a memory module.</p>

<p>The bad news is that you think the problem with the primary network server is a motherboard problem. The good news is that the problem may not actually be the motherboard; it just appears to be. Remember that there are components that are permanent to the motherboard and there are other components installed on the motherboard. The add-on components, processors, RAM, cooling, and more, could be the source of the problem, but unfortunately, it just might be the motherboard after all.</p>
<p>Never mind the fact that the motherboard may be the priciest component in the computer—it is likely the most difficult component to replace. Once you've convinced yourself that there is no doubt that the problem is absolutely, positively the motherboard, proceed with caution. Before removing the old board, label every wire and cable with what it connects to, where it connects to, and its place in the reassembly sequence. You'll be glad you did, trust me.</p>
<p>Rarely will a major component of a computer completely fail suddenly. Generally, it fails over time, giving signs that something may be wrong, and you should probably investigate. The following sections identify a few signs that something may be going wrong with a motherboard or its components, in no particular order of frequency or importance.</p>

<p>The three major electronic components on a motherboard are transformers, rectifiers, and electrolytic capacitors. A transformer in a computer's power supply decreases the voltage of the incoming electrical power. The <em>stepped down</em> power then passes through a rectifier that converts it from AC to DC. Since AC power fluctuates, the DC power that's produced by the rectifier also fluctuates. A capacitor, also known as an electrolytic capacitor or condenser, stores a static electrical charge. As the DC power on the motherboard fluctuates, a capacitor with <strong>Equivalent Series Resistance</strong> (<strong>ESR</strong>) provides enough current to <em>step up</em> the current.</p>
<p>A possible motherboard problem is the failure of a capacitor. As shown in the following image, a failing capacitor can begin to bulge or push up its top, leak out its electrolytic materials, or even catch fire. A failing capacitor isn't necessarily an emergency, but unregulated DC power can start to damage other components on the motherboard, including the processor:</p>

<p>If an electrical component, such as a capacitor, erupts or burns, the result is typically obvious: there is an electrical burn odor (ozone) or signs of burned components or circuits on the motherboard. An electronic component doesn't have to be on fire to make it look like it has burned. An electrical short can cause the same effect.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>You're working on a network server and need to install a file. You plug in a USB flash drive, but you get an error stating <span class="packt_screen">USB Device not recognized: One of the devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it</span> appears on the screen. Several issues could be the cause of this error. However, it's best to begin your troubleshooting with the most likely. One process goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that the flash drive works on another port or computer. If it doesn't work there, you know what the problem is.</li>
<li>Now that you know that the flash drive is good, check the USB port for visual damage, especially if it's an external device, and replace it, if needed.</li>
<li>Verify the device drivers for the USB drive and the USB root hub (refer to the following screenshot) for validity and version (don't worry if there are more root hubs than actual USB ports). If needed, reinstall or update the device drivers.</li>
<li>Check for loose cables or connectors or wires that are not seated in a connector. Replace or repair any problems you find.</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of these conditions appear to be causing the problem, take the appropriate action. However, if the problem doesn't appear to be hardware, it's likely that the problem lies with the operating system, device controller, firmware, or the root hub settings. Apply any operating system updates or patches pending installation. Update the system firmware, especially if the update references the USB or expansion bus. Check if the root hub has placed the USB device in a selective suspend state:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The expansion bus, also known as the external bus, provides a connection between an expansion slot (and an expansion card inserted into it) and the system bus. It's common for a motherboard to include multiple expansion bus standards to provide backward compatibility and component flexibility. The expansion buses on most current motherboards are the <strong>Accelerated Graphics Port</strong> (<strong>AGP</strong>), <strong>Peripheral Component Interconnect</strong> (<strong>PCI</strong>), <strong>PCI Expanded</strong> (<strong>PCI-X</strong>), and <strong>PCI Express</strong> (<strong>PCIe</strong>). The PCI bus is the most popular and is found on PC and Macintosh motherboards.</p>
<p>A common problem associated with expansion cards and buses is a form of <em>chip creep</em>. This condition, also know as power creep, is caused by the temperature cycles in the metal connectors of an expansion slot. Over time, an expansion card can begin to <em>wiggle</em> its way out of the expansion slot. To resolve this issue, firmly seat the card into the expansion slot (with the power off, of course).</p>
<p>If an expansion card was without problems when it was installed correctly, a failure or performance problem is likely to show up in the area associated with the card. Expansion cards are specific to one, maybe two, functions, components, or peripheral devices, such as video cards, sound cards, and network interface cards. So, if there is a problem with the card, it generally shows up on the supported device.</p>
<p>Should an expansion card that has been operating as it's meant to, suddenly show signs of problems, the most common causes are heat and power. Overheating can damage components on the card; a bad power supply can wreak havoc; or a major power surge may have affected all the internal electronics. Another cause for a condition that may appear to be an issue with an expansion card can occur when the motherboard and chipset include the same function as an installed expansion card. Removing the card may eliminate the problem.</p>
<p>Moving the card to a different expansion slot of the same type can verify whether the fault is with the card, with the expansion slot, or related to the bus, device driver, or chipset. However, the most common resolution to an expansion card problem is to replace the card with a known-good one.</p>

<p>Without a fully functional PSU, there is no computer. The electronics inside or attached to a computer run on a completely different type and level of electricity than any of your other electrical devices. Yes, the computer does plug into the wall outlet that provides it with 110 volts or 220 volts of AC electrical service, but its internal components operate on +/- 3.3 volts, +/- 5 volts, and +/- 12 volts of DC power. The conversion between the voltages of AC from the wall and the DC power for the computer is what the PSU is all about.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Even though the PSU is a major component of a computer and has the highest failure rate, it's a big deal when a PSU starts to fail and an even bigger deal when it fails completely. A power supply problem that's detected early can prevent serious problems with other internal components, which can be much harder to diagnose. The hardest part of troubleshooting a problem that could be related to a faulty power supply is that it could be the cause of just about any electrical problem in the computer, and often is. Some common signs that the PSU may be failing or have failed include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unusual noises coming from the back of the system case near the electrical cord's connection</li>
<li>Turning on the power switch doesn't start the computer, but it does start a flashing light on the front or the back of the computer</li>
<li>After starting up okay, the computer powers off after a very short time</li>
<li>While playing a game or using an application, the computer powers off suddenly and without warning, and perhaps displays the BSoD</li>
<li>The video display for a new game is distorted and the PSU's wattage and amperage are too low for the video card</li>
<li>The computer starts up, but the hard disk drive and the cooling system do not start up, causing the system to lock up</li>
<li>Touching the metal system case causes an electrical shock</li>
</ul>
<p>The remedy for a failing power supply is to replace it, even if only to determine if the PSU is the source of the detected problems.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Mechanical failure is the most frequent cause of problems in HDDs and even <strong>Solid State Drives</strong> (<strong>SSDs</strong>), to an extent. The mechanical internal components of an HDD are also its moving parts and, over time, moving parts can wear out and fail. On an HDD, failure comes with little, if any, warning. The failure horizon of an SSD is much longer. The common warranty on an SSD is ten years and manufacturers claim that an SSD will remain functional for over 300 years. So, let's focus on the HDD and its failure causes.</p>
<p>The frequent causes of HDD problems include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heat</strong>: By now, you've figured out that excessive heat inside a computer is a bad thing and that long periods of high temperatures can damage or destroy key components of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Moisture</strong>: It seems logical that an HDD that has been immersed in water may have some problems. However, the problems aren't necessarily inside the hard case around the spindles, heads, and platters, but water and electronic components don't mix well. Powering up a system that may not be completely dry can short out the electronic components, and not just those on the HDD.</li>
<li><strong>Electrostatic discharge (ESD)</strong>: On the other extreme, extremely dry conditions can produce almost the same damage as very humid or wet conditions. Static electricity can build up and cause components or circuits to fail, including the hard disk.</li>
<li><strong>Power surge</strong>: Routine power surges on the AC electrical service can degrade the overall performance of a computer over time, but severe electrical surges, such as a lightning strike, can easily destroy an HDD, along with all the electronics of a computer.</li>
<li><strong>Physical damage</strong>: The internal parts of an HDD operate with close tolerances that aren't designed for sudden jolts, drops, or impacts. If a computer, or even just an HDD, is dropped, hit, or impacted with enough force, the drive is likely to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that a computer problem may be caused by a hard disk drive, you can use the <strong>Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology</strong> (<strong><span>SMART</span></strong>) utility to display its status. This utility is available on nearly all operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS X. The following screenshot shows the results of a SMART hard disk error 301, which indicates that the HDD is failing and should be immediately backed up:</p>

<p>Obviously, if there are vertical or horizontal lines or bars covering a computer's video display, as shown in the following screenshot, there is something wrong. This condition is caused by either hardware or software. Choose one or the other to begin troubleshooting:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1082 image-border" src="Images/a5ea8f70-d8ec-4a8c-a291-9d0b93f8431c.jpg" style="width:66.67em;height:66.67em;" width="800" height="800"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Vertical lines and bars on a video display, indicating an issue</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If you begin troubleshooting the display as a software problem, use these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the website of the display's manufacturer, navigate to the support page, and access the graphics device drivers for your model</li>
<li>If there is more than one driver, install each one at a time and after completing them all, restart the computer</li>
</ol>
<p>If these steps resolved the problem, it was a software issue, most likely caused by a conflict or incompatibility between the operating system and the previous versions of the device drivers.</p>
<p>If you begin by troubleshooting the problem as a hardware issue, or if the software troubleshooting steps didn't resolve the problem, use these steps on systems with detached displays:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reboot the computer and open the BIOS/UEFI configuration system. If the problem is hardware related, booting into the BIOS/UEFI settings isolates the video display from the video drivers and chipset functions that are associated with the operating system and supports the display with only basic drivers.</li>
<li>If the display problem persists in the BIOS/UEFI system, it's a hardware problem. Correcting the problem is different for each manufacturer, and sometimes even between a manufacturer's different models. Go to the manufacturer's website to find the procedure to use to resolve the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few generic actions you can take, regardless of the make or model of the display. Check the cable to make sure it's connected properly at each end. Verify that the display is connected to the appropriate plug and video standard on the computer. Check the power cord and video connection cable for sharp bends, physical damage, and loose wire connections.</p>
<p>One last thing—if the video problem is on a laptop, notebook, or tablet computer, that is, any computer with an integrated display, it should be taken to a professional repair technician, preferably one representing the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Beyond the issues and causes that we've already discussed, there are other less specific problems that can show up on a computer system. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compatible components</strong>: If it becomes necessary to replace a major component in a computer, the replacement's compatibility with the existing or other new or replacement parts is very important for the improved operation of the computer. There are several websites available that can assist you in verifying that components are compatible. The following screenshot shows a sample of one such site, <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">https://pcpartpicker.com/</a>:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1083 image-border" src="Images/7a8b4ec9-4960-4897-b340-be2e9b1c7317.jpg" style="width:66.67em;height:54.25em;" width="800" height="651"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">An example of the compatibility checking on PCPartPicker.com</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incompatible BIOS</strong>: When installing or upgrading a Windows system, if the upgraded software stops and displays that Windows and the BIOS on the computer are incompatible, the problem is likely a CPU setting called the <strong>non-execute</strong> (<strong>NX</strong>) bit. This is a switch setting that controls the use of memory for various functions and blocks a part of the installation from running. To enable the NX bit, open a Command Prompt (with administrator privileges), enter the <kbd>exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOn</kbd> command, and press the <em>Enter</em> key. Shut down (not restart) the computer and then restart it. All should be well now.</li>
<li><strong>Server backplane failure</strong>: A backplane is a circuit board with several expansion slots that allows several components to share common bus structures and power sources. A backplane is only as good as its slot connectors and if there is a failure, a slot is left empty so that the backplane can be replaced.</li>
</ul>

<p>The environment of a server room or data center should be essentially the same, regardless of its location. A problem exists where the external environment may present one or more extremes in temperature, air quality, humidity, and severe weather conditions. A server room or data center must provide an environment that is conducive to the operations of electronic equipment, but to human administrators as well.</p>
<p>The primary environmental threats to a server room are temperature, humidity, contaminants in the air, and extreme fluctuations in the electrical power source. Here's a bit more on each of these elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: The ambient temperature in a server room should always be between 50° F (10° C) and 82° F (28° C), and optimally between 68° F (20° C) and 71° F (22° C). Computers can operate in an environment with consistent temperatures, regardless of whether they are cold or hot. Problems, such as condensation inside the system case, crop up when the temperature rises or falls rapidly or often.</li>
<li><strong>Air quality</strong>: Airborne contaminants, such as dust, insulation, and other particles carried into a server room can, if not controlled or cleaned, accumulate in the cooling systems, main boards, and electronics of computers, storage devices, power supplies, and other devices. Water from humidity is another airborne contaminant that can slowly saturate internal components. Problems such as overheating, electrical shorts, and corrosion can result from this contamination.</li>
<li><strong>Electrical power</strong>: Variations in the current of the electrical power service can damage and possibly destroy the equipment in a server room. Power surges, dips, brown-outs, and black-outs can stress equipment and possibly burn out or short out motors, controllers, and other electronic components. Power conditioners and <strong>uninterruptible power supply</strong> (<strong>UPS</strong>) units, should be employed to level out the electrical service.</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A computer hardware fault in an electronic component is a result of an issue in setup, installation, or configuration that leads to its malfunction or failure. Hardware issues include intermittent failures, access failures, random rebooting, and POST failures. System administrators should have the ability to identify and resolve common hardware issues.</p>
<p>The POST process verifies the presence and function of essential components and devices. Should the devices not respond, a pattern of audible beep tones sound to alert the user. POST uses a pattern of short or long beep sounds to indicate a problem. There is no standard set of beep codes.</p>
<p>Computers overheat commonly because of neglected preventive maintenance. Dust inside the case can block the airflow that's designed to cool components. Heat inside the system case can slowly deteriorate electronic components. The resolution of an overheating problem is to clean vents, fans, heat sinks, and air passages with compressed air.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons a processor fails: an extreme power surge, overclocking, or overheating. Measuring the CPU temperature sets a baseline. Any misalignment could create a false baseline. A processor should operate between 45° to 50° Celsius, which is 113° to 122° Fahrenheit, and not exceed 75° C (167° F).</p>
<p>Common memory problems and issues include gradual slowdowns, random restarts, corrupt files, failed installations, and BSoD. The causes of memory problems are the same as those for the CPU: heat, power surges, electrostatic damage, improper installation, overclocking, damaged memory slot, or faulty memory modules.</p>
<p>The three electronic components of a motherboard are transformers, rectifiers, and electrolytic capacitors. A transformer decreases the voltage of the incoming electrical power, which a rectifier then converts from AC to DC. A capacitor stores a static electrical charge, which the ESR uses to <em>step up</em> dips in the current. A failing capacitor bulges its top, leaks out its electrolytic material, or catches fire.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The expansion buses on most current motherboards are AGP, PCI, PCI-X, and PCIe. The PCI bus is the most popular and is found on PC and Macintosh motherboards.</p>
<p>The PSU converts AC of 110 volts or 220 volts of electrical service to DC power of 3.3 volts, 5 volts, and 12 volts of DC power. Common signs a PSU may be failing include strange noises, powering on not starting the computer, the computer powering off, and the HDD and cooling system not start. Mechanical failure is the most frequent cause of problems in HDDs. The causes of HDD problems include heat, moisture, ESD, power surge, and physical damage.</p>
<p>A server room or data center must provide an environment that is conducive to the operations of electronic equipment, but to human administrators as well. The primary environmental threats to a server room are temperature, humidity, contaminants in the air, and extreme fluctuations in the electrical power source.</p>
