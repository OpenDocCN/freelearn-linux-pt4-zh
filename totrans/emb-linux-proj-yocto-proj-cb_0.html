Over the last 10 years, this operating system has developed from dominating the server market to being the most used operating system in embedded systems, even those with real-time requirements. On the way, Linux has evolved, and the embedded industry has realized it has some key and unique characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Linux is quick to adapt to new technologies and it's the place where innovation happens first</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is robust, and the development community is quick to react to problems</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is secure, and vulnerabilities are discovered and dealt with in a much quicker way than in competing proprietary products</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is open, which means your company is able to own, modify, and understand the technology</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finally, Linux is free</li></ul></div><p>All of these make it a very compelling choice for embedded development.</p><p>But at the same time, an embedded Linux product is not only the Linux kernel. Companies need to build an embedded system over the operating system, and that's where embedded Linux was finding it difficult to make its place—until Yocto arrived.</p><p>The Yocto Project brings all the benefits of Linux into the development of embedded systems. It provides a standard build system that allows you to develop embedded products in a quick, reliable, and controlled way. Just as Linux has its strong points for embedded development, Yocto has its own too:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Yocto is secure, as it uses recent sources and provides the means to quickly apply security vulnerabilities to your products</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is robust, as it is used by a large community, which is quick to react to problems</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is open, so your company can own the technology, understand it, and make it fit for specific needs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is free</li></ul></div><p>With the Yocto Project's 6-month stable release process, package management updates, and flexibility, you will be able to focus on your embedded application, knowing that you are building it on top of a trusted system. You will speed up your development cycles and produce outstanding products.</p><p>But Yocto is a new technology, and developers need to adapt to it. This books aims to provide a practical guide for readers with basic knowledge of Linux and Yocto to develop a production-ready industrial system based on the ARM architecture.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. The Build System">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Build System</em></span>, describes the use of the Poky build system and extends it with the Freescale BSP community layer. It also describes common build system configurations and features used to optimize the building of target images.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. The BSP Layer">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The BSP Layer</em></span>, guides you through the customization of the BSP for your own product. It then explains how to configure, modify, build, and debug the U-Boot bootloader, the Linux kernel, and its device tree.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Software Layer">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Software Layer</em></span>, describes the process of creating a new software layer to hold new applications, services, or modifications to existing packages, as well as discussing a release process for license compliance.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Application Development">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Application Development</em></span>, starts with toolchains and the Application Development Toolkit (ADT), and deals with application development in detail, including development environments such as Eclipse and Qt creator.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Debugging, Tracing, and Profiling">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Debugging, Tracing, and Profiling</em></span>, discusses debugging tools and techniques, and explores the tracing functionalities offered by the Linux kernel, along with some of the user-space-tracing and profiling tools that make use of them.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book assumes some basic working knowledge with GNU/Linux systems; applications such as the bash shell and derivatives; as well as standard tools such as grep, patch, diff, and so on. The examples have been tested with an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS system, but any Linux distribution supported by the Yocto Project can be used.</p><p>This is not meant to be an introductory book to the Yocto project, and reading an introductory book, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Embedded Linux Development with Yocto Project</em></span> by Otavio Salvador and Daiane Angolini, also from Packt Publishing, is recommended.</p><p>This book is structured to follow the usual development workflow of an embedded Linux product, but chapters or even single recipes can be read independently.</p><p>The recipes take a practical hands-on approach using a Freescale i.MX6-based system, the wandboard-quad, as base hardware. However, any other piece of i.MX-based hardware can be used to follow the examples.</p></div>
