<p class="mce-root">VMware Horizon View, part of the VMware digital workspace, is the platform for delivering centralized, virtual desktop machines and applications, hosted on servers running on a hypervisor in the data center. End users connect remotely to their virtual desktop machines and apps from their endpoint device, such as a Windows laptop, Apple Mac, or tablet device.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This technology was first introduced by VMware in 2002, and has developed and matured to become the mainstream technology that we know today as <strong>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure</strong> (<strong>VDI</strong>). VDI provides users with the freedom to work in a way that suits them, by freeing them from the restrictions of not having to be in the office, but also allowing them the choice of device they use for making them more productive, and ultimately your business more agile.</p>
<p class="mce-root">From an IT administrator's perspective, it allows you to centrally manage your desktop environment, from being able to manage desktop images, to the ease of adding and removing user entitlements, all controlled from a single management console.</p>
<p class="mce-root">VMware Horizon 7 and Horizon View version 7.7 is VMware's latest virtual desktop solution, designed to centralize and virtualize your desktop environment using the market leading virtualization features and technology within VMware's <strong>Software Defined Data Center</strong> (<strong>SDDC</strong>) portfolio.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Horizon View 7 builds upon this technology platform, and today goes far beyond just VDI in delivering a rich user experience, enabling BYOD, flexible working, enhanced security, application delivery, and end-to-end management. Delivering an end user experience requires a different approach from other infrastructure-based initiatives, and getting this right is the key in terms of a project having a successful outcome, and this book will show you how to succeed.</p>
