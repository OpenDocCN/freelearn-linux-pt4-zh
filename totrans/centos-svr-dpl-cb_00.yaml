- en: For over a decade, the CentOS project has provided the community with a free,
    enterprise-grade operating system through the rebranding and recompilation of
    the Red Hat Enterprise Linux source. Since CentOS users rely almost exclusively
    on the community for their support needs, I was keen to write this book when Packt
    approached me about the project's latest release, CentOS 7\. The recipes we chose
    cover a wide range of topics, from getting started to managing many common web
    services, and hopefully administrators of any skill level will find something
    of interest.

    the staff at Packt, my family, and my friends, for their support. The dog needs
    to be taken for a walk, family engagements need attending, and emergencies arise
    at the workplace. Without the understanding and encouragement of those around
    me and the editorial staff, you wouldn't be reading this book.
