- en: 2006 was an exciting year. The disappointment that surrounded the dot-com crash
    had pretty much been superseded by a renewed and more confident growth of Web
    2.0 and inspired a search for technologies of a new age.

- en: At that time, I was looking for a web server to power my projects that would
    do many things in a different way. After getting some experience in large-scale
    online projects, I knew that the popular LAMP stack was suboptimal and sometimes
    did not solve certain challenges, such as efficient uploads, geo-dependent rate
    limiting, and so on.

- en: After trying and rejecting a number of options, I came to know about Nginx and
    immediately felt that my search was over. It is small yet powerful, with a clean
    code base, good extensibility, relevant set of features, and a number of architectural
    challenges solved. Nginx definitely stood out from the crowd!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I immediately got inspired and felt some affinity to this project. I tried participating
    in the Nginx community, learned, shared my knowledge, and contributed as much
    as I could.

- en: With time, my knowledge of Nginx grew. I started to get consultancy requests
    and have been capable of addressing quite sophisticated cases. After some time,
    I realized that some of my knowledge might be worth sharing with everyone. That's
    how I started a blog at [www.nginxguts.com](http://www.nginxguts.com).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A blog turned out to be an author-driven medium. A more reader-focused and more
    thorough medium was in demand, so I set aside some time to assemble my knowledge
    in the more solid form of a book. That's how the book you're holding in your hands
    right now came into existence.
