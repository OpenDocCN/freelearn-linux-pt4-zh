Once the operating system is installed, it can be expanded with many other software packages.</p><p>Raspbian is a good example of a Linux-based operating system. As Raspbian is based on Debian, it has access to its huge software repository. Raspbian initially had access to over 35,000 different software packages in the Debian repositories, but this number keeps growing.</p><p>Debian Wheezy, on <a class="indexterm" id="id279"/>which Raspbian is based, doesn't officially support the older ARMV6 CPU in the Raspberry Pi. During initial development of Raspbian in 2012, the developers spent a huge amount of time recompiling the vast collection of software in the Debian repositories for the ARMv6K architecture to get maximum performance out of the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>This chapter runs through several different methods of installing software on your Raspberry Pi.</p><div class="section" title="Package management in Linux"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec36"/>Package management in Linux</h1></div></div></div><p>There are many different tools available to manage software on a Linux distribution. Some of these include the APT and RPM package managers.</p><p>Raspbian uses the Advanced <a class="indexterm" id="id280"/>Packaging Tool, also known as the APT. The APT handles the dependencies of any package. Installation and removal of software packages are handled by an application called dpkg. It is the recommended way to install any software on your Raspberry Pi. Every part of Raspbian is bundled into a package.</p><p>The APT can automatically download the software that you want to install from repositories that are preconfigured. A repository is a collection of precompiled software that can be installed. These repositories are automatically selected, based on your location, to maximize download speed. It also automatically handles updates of all the software packages that are installed on your Raspberry Pi. The APT was first released in 1998 and is often hailed as one of Debian's best features.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Methods of installing software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec37"/>Methods of installing software</h1></div></div></div><p>There are several different ways to install <a class="indexterm" id="id281"/>software on your Raspberry Pi.

It is a <a class="indexterm" id="id283"/>software tool that actually installs a software package from a <code class="literal">.deb</code> file.</p><p>A <code class="literal">.deb</code> file contains three<a class="indexterm" id="id284"/> different parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A Debian-binary file that contains the version of dpkg needed to install the package</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A control archive that has all the information needed to install the package</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A data archive that contains the actual software itself</li></ul></div><p>dpkg reads the <code class="literal">.deb</code> file and determines whether all of the required software is installed.

It is preconfigured with several repositories that contain every official package that is <a class="indexterm" id="id286"/>available to be installed on your Raspberry Pi.</p><p>These repositories are split into several different archives or groups, depending on what software packages are contained in each. It is also extremely easy to add other third-party repositories.</p><div class="section" title="The main archive"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec16"/>The main archive</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">main</code> archive contains all of the software that makes up the Raspbian distribution. If the package is not in<a class="indexterm" id="id287"/> the archive, it is not considered a part of the Raspbian distribution. No packages in this archive require any software that is outside it. The Debian project requires that all packages in this archive should be free and can be distributed, modified, and shared freely. The software in this archive is supported by the Debian project.</p></div><div class="section" title="The contrib archive"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec17"/>The contrib archive</h3></div></div></div><p>Any package that requires <a class="indexterm" id="id288"/>other packages that aren't part of the <code class="literal">main</code> archive is included in the <code class="literal">contrib</code> archive. The <code class="literal">contrib</code> archive may also contain wrapper packages and other pieces of free software that work with non-free software.</p></div><div class="section" title="The non-free archive"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec18"/>The non-free archive</h3></div></div></div><p>Any other software that does not<a class="indexterm" id="id289"/> comply with the Debian project's guidelines for free software is included in the <code class="literal">non-free</code> archive.

This is achieved using public key encryption and a digital certificate to prove that the packages in the repository are from who they say they are.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Using the console"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec38"/>Using the console</h1></div></div></div><p>The most common <a class="indexterm" id="id291"/>way to install software on your Raspberry Pi is by using <code class="literal">apt-get</code>. It is a very powerful command-line application.</p><p>To run <code class="literal">apt-get</code>, you need to use the command shell. The command shell is available for you through an application that is installed in Raspbian by default. The application is called LXTerminal.</p><p>You can launch LXTerminal by double-clicking on its icon on the desktop.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Using the console" src="graphics/2192OS_05_01.jpg"/><div class="caption"><p>LXTerminal</p></div></div><p>LXTerminal allows you to run commands using the bash command shell (and other command shells if desired). You will learn more about the bash shell in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. The Console">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Console</em></span>.</p><p>Generally, each <a class="indexterm" id="id292"/>command you run fits in one line. When you have finished typing a command, simply press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> to run it. The output of the program will be displayed in the following lines. If you want to rerun or modify a command that you have just typed, simply press the up arrow key on your keyboard and you will see the previous command displayed again. You will then be able to edit and rerun it by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> again.</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>Don't forget that Linux is case sensitive, so the <code class="literal">Apt-get</code> command won't work but <code class="literal">apt-get</code> will!</p></div></div><p>Linux is an inherently secure operating system. Most of the commands in this chapter require administrator permissions. It is really easy to see whether you need root permissions. If they are required, you will see the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>To run a command as the system administrator, simply add it to the beginning of any command that you need to run:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sudo</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Depending on <a class="indexterm" id="id293"/>whether you have set a password or not, you may be asked to enter your password. Running <code class="literal">apt-get</code> is really simple just type <code class="literal">apt-get</code> and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">apt-get</code> command will<a class="indexterm" id="id294"/> respond with a heap of information about the different options that are available. The options that we are interested in are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">apt-get update</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">apt-get install</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">apt-get remove</code></li></ul></div><div class="section" title="apt-get update"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec55"/>apt-get update</h2></div></div></div><p>The first thing that we want to do is ensure that Raspbian knows what the latest versions of software are. The <a class="indexterm" id="id295"/>
<code class="literal">apt-get update</code> command automatically connects to the Raspbian repository and downloads the latest list of packages.</p><p>It is recommended<a class="indexterm" id="id296"/> that before installing any software, you run the <code class="literal">apt-get update</code> command if you haven't done so recently.</p></div><div class="section" title="apt-get install"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec56"/>apt-get install</h2></div></div></div><p>The real power of the apt packaging system becomes apparent when you run the <code class="literal">install</code> command. To <a class="indexterm" id="id297"/>actually install the software package on your<a class="indexterm" id="id298"/> Raspberry Pi, you need to run <code class="literal">apt-get install</code> followed by the name of the software package.</p><p>Consider the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sudo apt-get install apache2</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>This command will install the Apache2 web server. This is one of the most popular web servers in the world, with a 59% market share at the time of writing this book. Apache2 is extremely powerful but can be quite resource heavy depending on its configuration.</p><p>You will see something similar in your console to what is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="apt-get install" src="graphics/2192OS_05_02.jpg"/><div class="caption"><p>Installing Apache2 using apt-get install</p></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">apt-get</code> command <a class="indexterm" id="id299"/>will automatically connect to the Internet and download the <code class="literal">Apache2</code> package and<a class="indexterm" id="id300"/> all the packages that Apache2 needs to operate. You may be asked to confirm that you want to continue installing the software. Simply press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> key and then <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>. After the package is installed and configured, your new software is ready to go!</p><p>There are many packages that are available<a class="indexterm" id="id301"/> to extend the function of Apache2. These packages won't be installed by default. If you need to install these extras, they will need to be installed manually.</p><p>There are some packages that you are able to install, called metapackages. These packages represent a collection of packages that add a particular function to your Raspberry Pi. An example of this is as follows: if you used a distribution based on Raspbian that didn't include a graphical user interface, you could install this interface in one go by installing a metapackage. These packages behave as normal packages but are actually collections of several different packages behind the scenes. You are also able to use the * wildcard to represent multiple characters. To install all the available php packages, you could run this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sudo apt-get install php-*</strong></span>
</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="apt-get remove"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec57"/>apt-get remove</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, you will want to<a class="indexterm" id="id302"/> remove some software packages that have been installed and are no longer required. Removing a package is as <a class="indexterm" id="id303"/>easy as installing it. You simply use the <code class="literal">apt-get remove</code> command.</p><p>Run the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sudo apt-get remove apache2</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>You should get an output similar to this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="apt-get remove" src="graphics/2192OS_05_03.jpg"/><div class="caption"><p>Removing Apache2 using apt-get remove</p></div></div><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"/>Tip</h3><p>For a<a class="indexterm" id="id304"/> bit of fun, try<a class="indexterm" id="id305"/> running <code class="literal">apt-get moo</code>!</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Searching for packages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec58"/>Searching for packages</h2></div></div></div><p>There are so many packages available to install using <code class="literal">apt-get</code> that it can be difficult to find the package that you <a class="indexterm" id="id306"/>want to install. Fortunately, it is really easy to search for the packages that are available to be installed. To do this, you use the <code class="literal">apt-cache search</code> tool.</p><p>Following on from our example of using the <code class="literal">Apache2</code> package, you are able to see other extensions to the <code class="literal">Apache2</code> package by running this command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sudo apt-cache search apache2</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">apt-cache search</code> tool will list all the packages that mention <code class="literal">Apache2</code> in their description or require <code class="literal">Apache2</code>.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Synaptic GUI Package Manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec39"/>Synaptic GUI Package Manager</h1></div></div></div><p>There are many<a class="indexterm" id="id307"/> different ways in which you can install software on your Raspberry Pi. Using <code class="literal">apt-get</code> is one way. Another way is by using a GUI tool such as the <span class="strong"><strong>Synaptic Package Manager. </strong></span>Unfortunately, it isn't installed in Raspbian by default, but it is easily installed using <code class="literal">apt-get</code>.</p><p>To install synaptic, run the following command in LXTerminal:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

<div class="section" title="Installing software from source"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec41"/>Installing software from source</h1></div></div></div><p>All software programs are<a class="indexterm" id="id328"/> built from different files. These files are called source code and are written in programming languages. The most common programming languages that are used on Linux are C and C++.</p><p>There are all sorts of reasons that you may want to download and install a piece of software that is <a class="indexterm" id="id329"/>distributed as source code. Some of these are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The software isn't available in the Raspbian repositories.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The latest version of the software isn't in the Raspbian repositories.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The features in the software aren't available in the packages in the Raspbian repositories.</li></ul></div><p>There are a several disadvantages<a class="indexterm" id="id330"/> to installing software from source, such as these:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Updates aren't automatically installed for any software packages that are installed from source.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Additional software is required to compile and install the software.

Let's start with <code class="literal">./configure</code>. The <code class="literal">./configure</code> command<a class="indexterm" id="id333"/> is a script that generates the <code class="literal">MakeFile</code> file used by <code class="literal">make</code> to compile the software. This <code class="literal">MakeFile</code> file is customized to suit your Raspberry Pi. It will also let you know whether there are any other dependencies that you need to install to be able to build the software.</p><p>The <code class="literal">make</code> command is<a class="indexterm" id="id334"/> the command that actually compiles the software from the source code into an application that you can run on your Raspberry Pi. This compilation process will show lots of information as it progresses, and the process may take quite a long time. The Linux kernel can take well over half an hour to compile,so it is probably best to go and grab a cup of coffee!</p><p>After the applications have been compiled, you need to install them. Fortunately, most applications include an installation script that does this for you. Simply run <code class="literal">make install</code>!</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>Just remember that these instructions are generic and that some software packages may need to be installed differently.</p></div></div></div>
