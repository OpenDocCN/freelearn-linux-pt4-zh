    for upgrading your VMware View environment to the latest version, and, in this
    example, we will upgrade from Horizon 6 to Horizon 7\. We will start by discussing
    the elements that need to be considered before undertaking the upgrade, how we
    undertake the upgrade to ensure there is minimum disruption to our users, and
    finally, the step-by-step process to completing the upgrade.
