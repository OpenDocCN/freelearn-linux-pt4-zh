<p>Many software problems result from hardware issues. However, software can create, cause, or generate its own problems, faults, and errors related to, or completely independent of, hardware issues. In this chapter, we review common software problems, their causes, and some of the tools and utilities used to troubleshoot them.</p>
<p>The specific topic areas we look at in this chapter are as follows:</p>

<p>Typically, by the time an application or some system software is running on a server, it has been well tested in a test environment, run in a simulated production environment, and released to the production environment under close monitoring. Well, okay. Perhaps not all software goes through such a rigorous test and trial process as this, even though they should. Besides errors in logic, programming structure, and interfacing, what looks like a software error could be a hardware fault reflecting through a piece of software. Or, the software may be incompatible with the platform on which it's installed.</p>
<p>Software problems aren't the sole domain of application software. Problems and errors can be the result of misconfigured, improperly installed, or incompatible system software, device drivers, utility software, and even diagnostic and analysis software, and, of course, application software. In the sections that follow, common software problems are separated into two groups—hardware-related software problems and operating system problems.</p>

<p>There are four types of file recovery on a Windows system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong>: The <kbd>sfc.exe</kbd> file performs a scan of the hard disk looking for corrupted system files and folders. SFC works with <strong>Windows Resource Protection</strong> (<strong>WRP</strong>) which protects the registry files and other important system files. SFC can also be executed in Windows Safe Mode to eliminate any contention with third-party software. The following screenshot shows a typical result from <kbd>sfc.exe</kbd>:</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)</strong>: This command-line utility is basically a multi-tool that can scan, check, restore, and repair corrupted files on a hard disk or stored as a part of an image file. The following screenshot shows an example of DISM:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1119 image-border" src="Images/b44ed95e-5df5-4b51-81f3-3cb255853364.jpg" style="width:39.17em;height:10.75em;" width="798" height="219"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The DISM.exe utility</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replace the corrupted file</strong>: Provided that there is a backup of the last-known good copy of a corrupted file, you can simply overwrite the bad file with a copy of the good file. Remember that you may need to take ownership (<kbd>takeown</kbd>) and gain full administrative rights (<kbd>icacls</kbd>) of the corrupted file first.</li>
<li><strong>Restore system</strong>: If all other processes fail to recover a corrupted file, or if the number of corrupted files, the filesystem, or the partition is too large, the best approach is most likely restoring the system to its last-known good point.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several data and file recovery utilities available for Linux systems. These tools range from those that find and copy retrievable data and files from a corrupted partition or volume to a good storage medium, such as <strong>Ddrescue</strong>. Others attempt to repair the structure and retrieve the data of corrupted files and images, such as <strong>TestDisk</strong>. Many of the same utilities that run on Linux are also available for  macOS.</p>

<p>First off, some software problems are actually hardware problems or even malware problems. In some instances, it may be difficult to immediately determine the underlying cause of a problem and you must go with your best guess. However, next time, you'll have a better idea on what to do. What your first troubleshooting focus should be is fully explained by Gilster's law, as follows:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">"You never can tell; and it all depends."</div>
<p>Common hardware-related problems that can appear to be software issues include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blue Screen of Death (BSoD)</strong>: A BSoD is a Windows error condition report screen, (see the following screenshot), that notifies the computer's operator of a <em>stop error</em> condition, which halts the operating system. This condition signals the occurrence of an operational error involving a specific hardware component or that hardware's device driver. Windows gathers data related to the failure and restarts. A BSoD can also be displayed by components of the operating system's kernel. Application software typically cannot cause a BSoD to display, unless it causes a hardware or operating system error. However, when an application fails, it rarely takes the operating system or hardware with it:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1109 image-border" src="Images/487e708e-ef42-4ab7-8f43-704143864615.jpg" style="width:26.83em;height:10.58em;" width="726" height="285"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The BSoD display of a Windows 10 system</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk boot failure</strong>: This is also known as OS boot failure. Perhaps the most common cause of this error is that the boot sequence in BIOS/UEFI has a CD or DVD drive as the primary boot device and that drive is empty or has something other than a boot disk in it, in which case, the user should remove the CD or change the BIOS boot sequence and restart the computer. However, the problem could be a new unformatted hard disk, or a hard disk not connected to power.</li>
<li><strong>Cannot mount drive</strong>: The cause of this error depends on which operating system you are running. On a Windows system, this problem is likely a hardware issue with an external, probably USB, hard drive and the problem is specifically with the USB port, the connecting cable, or the external drive. However, on a Linux system, this problem could be a corrupted filesystem or an issue in the filesystem table file (<kbd>fstab</kbd>).</li>
</ul>

<p>As much as we'd like to think that operating systems are rock solid and error-free, reality and experience tell us that this is definitely not the case. An operating system, like all software, can have problems and produce errors when it comes together with different, and often incompatible, resources.</p>
<p>The following are common operating system problems and errors you may encounter on the Server+ exam:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User is unable to log in</strong>: Login problems for users are essentially the same on all of the big three operating systems—Windows, macOS, and Linux:
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: See the following table for common operating system-related login problems. The error message box shown in the following screenshot is an example of a common Windows login failure:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1111 image-border" src="Images/8b83934c-3052-42ae-aa34-8b21716f89da.jpg" style="width:43.83em;height:11.67em;" width="791" height="211"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>A Windows login error message box</span></div>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>macOS</strong>: Like other operating systems, macOS doesn't require a password for users, but highly recommends its use. However, if the password or username is forgotten, either or both can be reset in admin mode, in single user mode, or through the Apple ID account.</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: Most Linux releases and flavors incorporate the <strong>Pluggable Authentication Module</strong> (<strong>PAM</strong>) for authenticating username and password credentials. If a user is unable to log in with valid credentials, the PAM table may need to be reconstructed using the <kbd>pam-auth-update –package</kbd> command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Common Windows user login errors and possible causes include the following:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>User cannot access resources</strong>: If this error indicates a denied access to resources on a single computer or on a shared network resource, it is very likely a permissions problem for an individual user account or a group account of which the user is a member. However, if the error is about denied access to resources on a peer-to-peer network, the problem may be a TCP/IP configuration issue or a browser error on one of the peer stations.</li>
<li><strong>Users cannot print</strong>: In most cases, this condition may be something as simple as an incorrect printer driver on the affected computer, or it could be a group policy problem. Isolate the problem by logging in with a well-known account to determine if the issue is local or global.</li>
<li><strong>Driver issues</strong>: A new device trying to run with the driver of a previous model may not have the best results. Driver issues are typically compatibility problems with its associated device driver. These problems can also be caused by errors in the BIOS/UEFI configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Cannot write to system log</strong>: Users must have authorization to write to system log files. On a Windows system, the registry entry for the log file you wish to grant write permission to a user, edit the log file's entry in the registry's <kbd>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</kbd> key. On a Linux system, a log file directory that is owned by the user should be created.</li>
<li><strong>Slow OS performance</strong>: All operating systems slow down when one or more programs dominate the system resources, primarily the CPU, memory, and secondary storage. Using the appropriate tool, such as Windows' Task Manager, macOS's Activity Monitor, and Linux's <kbd>systemctl</kbd> command, end the resource hogs that aren't crucial and perhaps review the programs and services in the startup file.</li>
<li><strong>Runaway process</strong>: Any program or service that gets into an infinite loop and perhaps launches other jobs is runaway. On a Windows system, open the Task Manager and end the process. On a macOS system, use the Activity Monitor to end the process. On a Linux system, use the <kbd>ps</kbd> command to <em>kill</em> the process.</li>
<li><strong>Patch update failure</strong>: If, after applying a patch to the operating system, one or more components, services, or applications begins having problems and you're sure the problem is the update or patch, use the system's backup utility to revert to your previous state. In Windows, this is the <span class="packt_screen">Go back to a previous version</span> function on the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> menu. On a macOS system, run the <span class="packt_screen">Reinstall macOS</span> utility from recovery mode. On a Linux system, use the <span class="packt_screen">Last-Known Good</span> option on the <span class="packt_screen">GRUB</span> menu.</li>
<li><strong>Service failure</strong>: The message <span class="packt_screen">The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it</span> indicates that one or more services, programs, or scripts have failed to start. You need to isolate the service and either reload it or a new version.</li>
<li><strong>Hangs on shutdown</strong>: If an operating system fails to shut down, when directed to do so, the problem likely is one or more of three basic issues—a process or service won't stop, a device driver is hung up or is holding a device open, or malware is causing the operating system to hang.</li>
<li><strong>Memory leak</strong>: This condition happens when a program fails to release some or all of its allocated memory when it's no longer needed. Memory leaks also happen when software loads an object to memory that cannot be accessed by its programming code. If multiple instances of the program causing the problem are executed, the system could eventually run out of available memory. Tools such as the <span class="packt_screen">Windows Memory Diagnostic</span> utility (see the following screenshot) can help to resolve these errors:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1113 image-border" src="Images/d8c7ad6a-1967-4eae-95bb-869ba69ef083.jpg" style="width:29.50em;height:22.50em;" width="790" height="602"/></p>

<p>The purpose of the UAC (and <kbd>sudo</kbd>) is to restrict changes to the system to only those authorized to do so. In most situations, this would be the responsibility of the administrator using an administrator-level account. The problems associated with having the UAC enabled is that each time new or modified software installs, the user must enter an administrative password. UAC can be set at one of four levels, which range between <span class="packt_screen">Always notify</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Never notify</span>, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p>Depending on where the system administrator sets the UAC level, the user must enter an administrator account password (<span class="packt_screen">Always notify</span>) or is never asked for a password (<span class="packt_screen">Never notify</span>). Too much user account control can lead to installation mistakes, malware, and serious application or system errors:</p>

<p>Although they use slightly different formats, Windows, Linux/Unix, and macOS use essentially the same access permissions structure. Access rights and permissions are specified on three levels—the owner (creator), the owner's group, and everyone else. Linux and macOS, which are built on a UNIX-like foundation, use the same permissions scheme. While Windows is similar, it presents it very differently.</p>
<p>On a Windows system, the equivalent of an access control list that defines what a user or group can access, open, modify, write, or delete is defined in the user's or group's permissions. The following screenshot shows the <span class="packt_screen">Advanced Security Settings for Windows</span> dialog box which provides access to the existing permissions of all users or groups and access to administrators to modify the permissions:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1116 image-border" src="Images/85ebc807-79d1-4b34-8fed-e93f3a62f8e7.jpg" style="width:66.67em;height:41.83em;" width="800" height="502"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The Windows Advanced Security Settings dialog box</div>
<p>Because the macOS operating system is built on top of <span><strong>Portable Operating System Interface</strong> (</span><strong>POSIX</strong>), which is a UNIX/Linux workalike, macOS and Linux use essentially the same commands and permission sets to allow or restrict user access to resources. System administration can designate not only the access levels for the file owner, the owner's group, and everyone else, but can also control who is able to execute certain commands that may alter or manipulate a file, its directory, or its contents.</p>
<p>The file permissions of a Linux/UNIX/POSIX file or director is in the format shown in the following screenshot. In the leftmost section of this display, there are four sections. The first is a single character that is either a <kbd>d</kbd> for directory or a <kbd>-</kbd> for file. The next nine characters are three sets of three permission indicators, which represent, from left to right, the permissions of the file owner, the group of the owner, and all other users, respectively. For example, the <kbd>apps</kbd> <span>directory </span>is indicated with a <kbd>d</kbd> in the first position, and each of the three permission groups have read (<kbd>r</kbd>) and execute (<kbd>x</kbd>) rights. The <kbd>game1</kbd> <span>file</span> is not a directory (<kbd>-</kbd>) and the owner and group have read, write (<kbd>w</kbd>) , and execute permissions. The permissions of others is only read and execute:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1117 image-border" src="Images/dfb4a0c9-0590-4d6b-a80d-7c351d53c5ef.jpg" style="width:35.00em;height:12.67em;" width="774" height="280"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">A Linux directory file list showing type, permissions, owner, group, size, and creation information</div>
<p>In either operating system, if a user tries to access or execute a file or directory for which they don't have permission, the user is asked for a password or at least challenged on whether or not this is the action they intended.</p>

<p>The reasons as to why a file, filesystem, or even, heaven forbid, a hard disk partition, becomes corrupted are many and varied. Unfortunately, you typically discover this problem when the data or program is needed at that exact moment. While not all corrupted files are recoverable, the majority are, depending on the extent of the damage and, in some cases, what caused it. However, there are cases where data has been recovered from hard disk with broken platters, heavy water or fire damage, and other catastrophes. For the most part, a server administrator such as yourself may only encounter a file or two that the system can't find or read.</p>

<p>You're working on installing new mission-critical software, when an error notice, such as the one shown in the following screenshot, pops up. The knee-jerk reaction, and this may be the correct reaction, is to remove anything on the hard disk that is no longer used or has simply been forgotten. However, there are other options to be considered:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1120 image-border" src="Images/cb2b5e33-2d86-4d83-ac3e-e28affe82e32.jpg" style="width:27.50em;height:5.58em;" width="749" height="153"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">A low disk space pop-up in Windows Server</div>
<p>In Windows, to free up disk space, you can make use of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compression</strong>: Compressing all or a large part of the files on the hard disk can free up space. In some instances (it really depends on the data being compressed), as much as 20 percent of the disk's capacity is made available. Remember that this could slow down I/O operations, though.</li>
<li><strong>Disk management utility</strong>: The Windows <span class="packt_screen">Disk Management</span> utility allows you to reallocate disk space that is <em>healthy</em>, but doesn't have a drive letter assigned to it. Be sure that you have the entire disk backed up, just in case you forgot something about that space. Regardless, you can add this space to the system disk partition.</li>
<li><strong>Temp folder</strong>: The problem of low disk space could be the result of a <kbd>Temp</kbd> folder that hasn't been emptied recently, if ever.</li>
<li><strong>Storage sense</strong>: This is another Windows utility that can identify marginal files that are taking up a disproportionate amount of disk space and provide you with the opportunity to delete them.</li>

<p> </p>
<p>On Linux and macOS, the following options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk usage/disk free</strong>: These two commands (<kbd>du</kbd> and <kbd>df</kbd>) list the amount of disk space that is in use and is free, respectively, on the current mounted filesystem.</li>
<li><strong>List open files</strong>: Another command that can help you to find free space, or space that can be freed up, is the <kbd>lsof</kbd> command. This command has more than a dozen options that list files that are currently in use and are opened by running jobs at some point. This list identifies files that probably shouldn't be removed.</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Unfortunately, the term <em>system resources</em> is non-specific and, when included in an error message, as in <em>memory error</em> or a <em>lack of system resources</em>, it may not be telling you anything specific. For example, a memory error doesn't mean you've used up all of the available main memory. In most cases, it actually means that the computer has run out of, or used up, an area in memory set aside by the system and called a <strong>heap</strong>. A heap is the area of memory that a running job has allocated dynamically over and above its allocation from the system. When the portion of memory reserved for heaps runs out, a memory error is generated. A heap is also considered to be a system resource.</p>
<p>In most cases, the immediate fix for an error resulting from a shortage of system resources is to restart the computer. However, to track down the problem and fix it so it doesn't keep happening, you need to isolate what is causing the problem. If this problem occurs each time you're running one particular application, take note of what else is running. You may have a compatibility or a resources contention issue.</p>
<p>In any case, you should use the Event logs and the Task Manager, (see the following screenshot) to investigate what was running at the time the problem happened and what jobs are dominating the CPU and main memory. You know, the problem could also be that you just need more RAM:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Virtual memory problems</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Virtual memory, like all things virtual, is not memory at all. Rather, it is a portion of secondary storage that the operating system treats as an extension of main memory. Virtual memory, also known as <strong>swap</strong> file, allows more jobs to run on the computer. The operating system moves portions of idle jobs out of the main memory into virtual memory to allow an active job to use the now-available memory space. The drawback to virtual memory is that most secondary storage devices, such as a <strong>hard disk drive</strong> (<strong>HDD</strong>), are much slower than RAM, which can add latency to a process.</p>
<p>One of the more common issues with virtual memory is evidenced when the <span class="packt_screen">Out of Virtual Memory</span> alert displays, as shown in the following screenshot. What this error means is that there are too many jobs running in main memory and, as a result, there isn't enough RAM to go around. If this issue happens frequently, the best solution is to increase the RAM capacity. The next best solution is to increase the amount of virtual memory. There are no hard and fast rules concerning how much virtual memory you should configure, but its size should never be more than 150 percent of the amount of RAM installed on the computer. Getting the amount of virtual memory exactly right is a challenge. Too much or too little can work against you and slow down the computer:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1122 image-border" src="Images/62594652-fcb3-47db-b45f-57689497718d.jpg" style="width:35.42em;height:8.67em;" width="795" height="194"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"> Windows alert for low virtual memory</div>
<p>Another problem that can occur when virtual memory is enabled is caused by a corrupted pagefile. Virtual memory is actually a pagefile (<kbd>pagefile.sys</kbd> to be exact), which is an allocated space on a hard disk where the operating system can temporarily store idle programs and data. When you minimize a window on the desktop or pause an application, some or all of that job becomes idle. By moving it out of RAM and into a pagefile, the other jobs competing for RAM are able to run a bit faster. So, <em>what happens if the pagefile becomes corrupted?</em> The good news is that virtual memory is only used when there is not enough RAM to support the jobs running on the computer. If you never run out of RAM, the pagefile is idle anyway. Otherwise, run the <kbd>sfc /scannow</kbd> command that we discussed earlier to repair the pagefile.</p>

<p>When a very small file is written to a hard disk, it's placed in a small disk area called a <strong>sector</strong>, which is typically 512 bytes in length. If a larger file, say one that is 1 MB, is written to the hard disk, obviously it won't fit into one sector. Therefore, the disk controller will break the file into about 2,000 pieces and store each into a sector. Not all of the available sectors are necessarily contiguous, so the file pieces end up being store all over the medium. As other files, large and small, take up sectors throughout the disk and the pieces of our first file reduce, enlarge, or disappear, sectors become open and new sectors are created. As sectors come and go, the original placement of the file pieces becomes more distributed and randomized. This is <strong>fragmentation</strong>.</p>
<p>Hard disk fragmentation can cause reliability problems, such as boot failures, file corruption, system hang-ups, and data errors or loss. It can also cause performance problems such as slowing I/O operations, lengthening the time for disk scans, and increasing the condition of disk thrashing. Defragmentation utilities shuffle the file pieces around so that the pieces of a file are as close to being on sequential sectors and sequential tracks as logically and physically possible.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Printers of all types have remained an essential part of any network, large or small. However, the technology has allowed fewer printers to serve larger user groups. This is possible because of a variety of related technologies, but primarily due to the evolution of the print server.</p>
<p>A <strong>print server</strong> is either software or a dedicated device that provides an interface between network clients and one or more network printers. It is also a <strong>single point of failure</strong> (<strong>SPOF</strong>) in most cases. As with software and hardware, there is no one standard protocol used for sending a print job to a print server and then on to the printer. Adding a print server to a network can solve a number of printing issues, not only for users, but for the administrators as well.</p>
<p>A common problem with print servers is slowing down. There are several causes for a print server to run slow, including some unique to a particular installation, but a few others are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bottlenecks</strong>: If the print server seems to lock up with several print jobs in its queue, it's possible that there is a problem with memory or a service that may be consuming its resources. The best way to learn what may be causing this problem is to monitor the Windows Task Manager when no print jobs are running and then again with one print job and on up to everybody printing. Somewhere along this line, you should identify the culprit.</li>
<li><strong>Print management</strong>: You can access the settings for a network's print server(s) on the Windows <span class="packt_screen">Print Management</span> page as shown in the following screenshot. Setting the options on each printer to print after spooling, print spooled jobs first, and assigning it a relative priority establishes a ranked queue that eliminates contention:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1123 image-border" src="Images/73a14e40-75ae-48ca-a6cb-473d1243e7e0.jpg" style="width:43.75em;height:31.67em;" width="1000" height="724"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"> The Windows Print Management page showing the properties of a printer supported by the print server</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other remedies</strong>: Every network is somewhat unique, especially concerning printers. To speed up network-based printing, there are a variety of actions that may or may not be appropriate to any particular network. A few of these actions are as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Print spooling on dedicated storage</strong>: Spooling print jobs on a computer that supports active or large-volume applications can slow the I/O operations involved. Dedicating an isolated hard drive specifically to the spooler can speed things up.</li>
<li><strong>Add storage to the print server</strong>: Something most users don't consider, if they know about it at all, is that print jobs grow in size when they are rendered for the printer. If several print jobs are vying for storage space on the print server, the logjam that results could slow the overall performance of the print server. Adding additional secondary storage to the print server can help to avoid this issue.</li>
<li><strong>Clear the queue</strong>: On occasion, a print job gets hung up in the print queue and blocks all other print jobs behind it. There are a couple of ways to force the print queue to empty—end the print spooler service or run <kbd>net stop spooler</kbd> from Command Prompt and delete the queue from the spooler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Operating systems keep log files, and this is a good thing. Log files provide a running history of the events, actions, errors, and actions deserving a warning, and some good things too. Troubleshooting an operating system or an application problem should typically start with a look at, and some analysis of, one or more of the system's log files. The following screenshot shows the Windows <span class="packt_screen">Event Viewer</span>, which provides a look at the contents of a variety of system log files:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1124 image-border" src="Images/3ca5d836-4c1d-42cb-9bca-f28b2f9ff8d3.jpg" style="width:100.42em;height:65.75em;" width="1205" height="789"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The Windows Event Viewer can be used to scan log files for issues</div>
<p>On a Linux or macOS (POSIX) system, the system logs are centralized into the <kbd>/var/log</kbd> directory. The following screenshot shows the Command Prompt entries to list and then display one of the log files on a Linux system. There are also third-party software packages for viewing and analyzing log files on all three operating systems:</p>

<p>System software problems can be from misconfigured, improperly installed, or incompatible device drivers, utility software, diagnostic software, and application software. Common hardware-related problems that can appear as software issues include BSoD, disk boot failure, and drive mounting issues. Common operating system problems include the user being unable to log in, the user being unable to access resources, users unable to print, device driver issues, system log errors, slow performance, runaway processes, service failure, and memory leaks.</p>
<p>Windows defines access permissions to a user or group. macOS and Linux allow or restrict user access and control the user's ability to manipulate a file. Windows file recovery options include SFC, DISM, replacing the corrupted file, and restoring the system to an earlier checkpoint. Linux systems use tools that find and copy retrievable data from the corrupted medium and tools that retrieve and repair data from corrupted files. Many Linux utilities also run on macOS. Low disk space warnings and errors on Windows can be resolved using compression, the Windows Disk Management utility, and unneeded data in temporary or search work files. On Linux and macOS, the <kbd>du</kbd> and <kbd>df</kbd> commands show the amount of disk space in use and the amount free, and the <kbd>lsof</kbd> command shows the files that shouldn't be removed.</p>
<p>The fix for a shortage of system resources is to restart the computer. Use the Event logs and the Task Manager to see what's running when the problem happened and what's dominating the CPU and main memory. A common issue with virtual memory is the <span class="packt_screen">Out of Virtual Memory</span> alert, which means there isn't enough RAM to support current demands. Hard disk fragmentation can cause boot failures, file corruption, and data errors. Defragmentation utilities move file pieces as close to being on sequential sectors and sequential tracks as possible.</p>
<p>A print server is a SPOF that can solve a number of printing issues. A common problem with print servers is slowing down, which may be caused by bottlenecks, the lack of printer management, or insufficient dedicated storage for print spooling, and can be solved by adding storage to the print server and clearing the print queue. Log files provide a record of the events, actions, errors, and warnings of the jobs running on the computer. Troubleshooting any software problems should start with a look at system log files. On Linux and macOS, system logs are in the <kbd>/var/log</kbd> directory.</p>
