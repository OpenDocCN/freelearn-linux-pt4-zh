    of the latest version of the Ubuntu Server. The purpose of this book is to guide
    the readers so that they can deploy and configure Ubuntu servers in their office
    environments. First of all, we will start by explaining how to install the Ubuntu
    Server. Then, we will move on to cover the most useful aspect of the command-line
    interface that comes with it. Meanwhile, we will have a look at how to administrate
    and configure an Ubuntu Server. This knowledge will be extended with the help
    of a chapter dedicated to this topic. After that, we will discuss how to deploy
    services on an Ubuntu Server and secure it. Before finishing, we will discover
    the virtualization and Cloud computing facilities provided by Ubuntu. Finally,
    we will explore some very useful tips related to an Ubuntu Server.
