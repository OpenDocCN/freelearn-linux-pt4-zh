- en: Starting from the mainframe days, server virtualization has a long history.
    However, today's data centers use virtualization features to abstract physical
    hardware, which would be a pool of resources such as CPU, storage, and memory,
    to the end users in the form of virtual machines. The easiest way to ensure server
    resource utilization is improved is through virtualization techniques. Server
    virtualization success has been hailed as a transformational event in data centers
    primarily because a single physical machine can run multiple operating systems
    and each operating system can be managed like a dedicated physical machine. This
    is a very simple but highly powerful solution. There are different types of virtualization,
    such as server, storage, application, desktop, and the industry's newest buzzword
    is network virtualization. Network virtualization has been on the market for a
    long time. VLANs, VPNs, MPLS, VPLS, and VSS are all widely used examples of network
    virtualization. If you have worked in a data center, you would agree that networking
    is always challenging to work with. Network architects are forced to perform manual
    configuration, which results in configuring VLANs, ACLs, routing, firewall rules,
    QoS, load balancing, and so on. The drawback for this model is complex and slow,
    and in a dynamic cloud environment, the complexity would increase.

    by VMware as *"A unified data center platform that provides unprecedented automation,
    flexibility, and efficiency to transform the way IT is delivered. Compute, storage,
    networking, security, and availability services are pooled, aggregated, and delivered
    as software, and managed by intelligent, policy-driven software"*. An SDDC is
    the mechanism through which cloud services can be delivered most efficiently.
    One of the key goals of an SDDC is to build a cloud-based data center. Vendors
    such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and VMware all have their own set of public cloud
    services running on an SDDC stack . Yes, now we have a next-generation data center
    wherein we could pool all physical servers and let applications run according

    is a hypervisor-based storage abstraction from the heterogeneous model of physical

    array features, such as replication, deduplication, thin provisioning, and snapshots.
    Since this is a completely software-defined storage, we have increased flexibility,
    ease of management, and cost efficiency. In this way, pooled storage resources
    can be automatically and efficiently mapped to application needs in a software-defined
    data center environment. VMware VSAN is a classic example of SDS since it is a

    Defined Data Center** (**SSDC**) center and gives the full set of Layer 2-Layer
    7 networking services such as routing, switching, firewall, load balancing, and
    QoS at the software layer. Network virtualization is the virtualization of network
    resources using software and networking hardware that enables faster provisioning
    and deployment of networking resources. The innovation speed of software is much
    faster than hardware and the answer for the future is not a hardware-defined data
    center but a Software Defined Data Center which will let us extend the virtualization
    layer across physical data centers. What makes Amazon and Google the world''s
    largest data center is the brilliance of Software Defined Data Center. Network
    virtualization provides a strong foundation by effectively resolving all traditional
    network challenges to ensure we are getting a fully-fledged SDDC stack. As the
    cloud consumption model is being rapidly adopted across the industry, the need
    for on-demand provisioning of compute, storage, and networking resources is greater
    than ever. Network virtualization decouples the networking and security features
    from physical hardware and allows us to replicate similar network topology in
    a logical network.'

    software-defined networking and network virtualization and was founded by Martin
    Casado, Nic Mckeown, and Scott Shenker in 2007\. On July 23, 2012, VMware acquired
    Nicira and NSX is a product which was created from VMware **vCloud Networking
    Security** (**vCNS**) and the Nicira network virtualization platform. As of now
    VMware NSX-v can be integrated with vSphere, vCloud Director, and vCloud Automation
    Center which gives fully-fledged network automation in private cloud. A multi-hypervisor
    environment, such as Xen server, KVM, or VMware ESXi with a choice of cloud management
    solution such as vCloud automation center, OpenStack, and CloudStack, can also
    be integrated with VMware NSX. This book features the **NSX-VMware** (**NSX-V**)
    version of NSX only. NSX-V will be referred to as NSX for the rest of the book.

    the network traffic in any data center environment. Traditional network architectures
    were based on a series of switches and routers, and those types of network architecture
    would perfectly fit in a client-server environment. Today's application workloads
    are highly in need of reducing the number of hops when they are communicating
    in a network. In modern-day application requirements, virtual machines talk to
    each other sitting in the same rack or a different rack before sending a reply
    packet to the client which is outside the data center. Workloads are moving from
    server memory to server flash drives for analysis. Big data, virtualization, and
    cloud have highly contributed to such types of traffic. Hence, we certainly need
    an intelligent networking for such big application workloads. Lack of speed and
    flexibility in provisioning a network is addressed with the help of network virtualization
    features.
