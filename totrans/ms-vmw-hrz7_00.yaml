- en: VMware Horizon View, part of the VMware digital workspace, is the platform for
    delivering centralized, virtual desktop machines and applications, hosted on servers
    running on a hypervisor in the data center. End users connect remotely to their
    virtual desktop machines and apps from their endpoint device, such as a Windows
    laptop, Apple Mac, or tablet device.

- en: This technology was first introduced by VMware in 2002, and has developed and
    matured to become the mainstream technology that we know today as **Virtual Desktop
    Infrastructure** (**VDI**). VDI provides users with the freedom to work in a way
    that suits them, by freeing them from the restrictions of not having to be in
    the office, but also allowing them the choice of device they use for making them
    more productive, and ultimately your business more agile.

- en: Horizon View 7 builds upon this technology platform, and today goes far beyond
    just VDI in delivering a rich user experience, enabling BYOD, flexible working,
    enhanced security, application delivery, and end-to-end management. Delivering
    an end user experience requires a different approach from other infrastructure-based
    initiatives, and getting this right is the key in terms of a project having a
    successful outcome, and this book will show you how to succeed.
