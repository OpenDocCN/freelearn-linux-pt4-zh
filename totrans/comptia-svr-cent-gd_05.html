<p>A computer system has five major components: hardware, software, people, documentation, and data. Without any one of these components, there would be little or no purpose of the system. Of course, there is another version that identifies the <strong>input–process–output</strong> (<strong>IPOS</strong>) model, which consists of inputs, processing, outputs, and storage (referring to main memory, not disk drives). In either of these models, software and processing, while equally important to the other components of their respective models, represent the catalyst that allows us to accomplish something on a computer.   </p>
<p>In the first three chapters of this book, we looked at the typical hardware of a network server, including its external and internal hardware and the hardware that's used for storing data. In this chapter, we will move on and look at the primary software of all computer systems—the operating system and, in particular, <strong>network operating systems</strong> (<strong>NOSes</strong>). In this chapter, we will focus on the three most popular (and the ones you'll encounter in the Server+ exam)—Windows Server, Linux Enterprise, and macOS Server.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network server</li>
<li>OS and hardware</li>
<li>Boot sequence</li>
<li>Filesystems</li>
<li>Network configuration</li>
<li>User accounts</li>
<li>NOS optimization</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all, let's agree on what a network server is and what its functions may be. As we discussed in <a href="79e86743-32d3-4ae6-bc33-83018f475c12.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Server Hardware</em>, a server is technically a software package running on a network computer that processes, responds to requests from hosts, and provides resources to fulfill requests from network clients. There are many different types of servers, each with its own purpose and function. In the following sections, we will look at the various servers you may encounter in the Server+ exam.</p>

<p>The general function of a network server is to provide services to network clients. At its most basic level, a server, just like those in a restaurant, serves the needs of its clients. And just like the servers in a restaurant, there are specialized servers for different responsibilities, such as the wine steward, the cook, and the bus person, focused on one purpose or group of related purposes.</p>
<p>However, if we expand the definition of a network server to also include the hardware, operating system, management utilities, protocols, data stores, and communications, its function will include the provisions of administration, security, resources, and other services to network clients. A network server may support a single role, function, or application. A network-connected computer may support several server roles and applications.</p>
<p>Regardless of the server software running on the server hardware and the roles the server fulfils on a network, one thing is constant on every server—the NOS. Not every network node that supports one type of server software or another requires an NOS, but those servers that administer user accounts, access, and security certainly do.</p>

<p>There are several differences between what we call an <em>operating system</em> and a <em>network operating system</em>. The differences go beyond, but are directly related to, the inclusion of <em>network</em> in the title. Like nearly all computer operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS, an NOS provides system control and management functions, but to multiple workstations.</p>

<p>A computer's OS is the system software that provides the means for a user to make use of the computer hardware. An OS manages, controls, secures, and administers the physical electronics of a computer. For the most part, we tend to take the OS on our computers for granted, with little thought to how it works or just what it does. After all, it only makes everything we do possible!</p>
<p>An OS has five primary functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>User/computer communication</li>
<li>Memory management</li>
<li>Control and coordination of hardware</li>
<li>Internal and network file management</li>
<li>User, data, application, and resource security</li>
</ul>

<p>Users communicate with an OS or an application through a <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (<strong>GUI</strong>) or a <strong>command-line interface</strong> (<strong>CLI</strong>). The facilitation of this communication is a primary function of any OS. The following screenshot illustrates both a GUI and a CLI through which users select or enter requests or commands:</p>

<p>An OS, network or otherwise, has the responsibility of allocating memory to user or system-initiated programs. When a user starts a process or program that's not a part of the OS kernel, which means it's already in memory (more than likely), it's copied from secondary storage into an allocated space in main memory. The allocated memory space serves as a holding area for the program's instructions and data, before and after passing this to cache memory and the CPU.</p>

<p>The OS typically loads smaller programs, those consisting of only one module, and data blocks often load to memory completely. However, larger programs, especially those with several modules, can't fit into the available memory to be allocated, so the OS uses a process called dynamic loading. <strong>Dynamic loading</strong> loads the first module of a program, the one with the first instruction, and then loads other modules into the same space when needed.</p>
<p>Another approach to memory management is <strong>dynamic linking</strong>. Many programs, especially those developed as <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> (<strong>OOP</strong>), have an associated library of definitions, methods, and functions. As the program executes, the OS creates a link to any object invoked in a module to its definition in the library for execution. This avoids the need to load the entire library into memory.</p>

<p>Memory allocation is the process that's used by the OS to allocate and assign memory space to a program. Generally, there are four approaches to the allocation process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First fit</strong>: The first memory space block in the memory available table that is large enough to fit the needs of the program or module</li>
<li><strong>Next fit</strong>: The next memory space block immediately after the last memory block allocated that fits the needs of the program or module</li>
<li><strong>Best fit</strong>: The smallest available block of memory large enough to meet the needs of the program or module</li>
<li><strong>Worst fit</strong>: Any available block of memory that is larger than the needs of the program or module</li>
</ul>
<p>The memory management function of an OS may use any of the preceding memory allocation approaches. In any case, allocations are either static or a dynamic. Compilers often determine the <strong>static allocations</strong> of a program and its modules. <strong>Dynamic allocations</strong> are fluid. Dynamic loading and linking are two types of dynamic memory allocation.</p>

<p>The OS is able to communicate with some devices, such as the keyboard, through the computer's BIOS, since there are standard devices that use a simple, standard command set. However, many devices and components have unique sets of commands and instructions that are typically not compatible with other devices. It's virtually impossible for an OS to include the commands needed to communicate with every possible make and model of internal and external devices installed on a computer. For this reason, device driver software, which is unique to a particular device make or model, acts as a go-between for the OS and the device controller. Device drivers make it possible for the OS to coordinate the actions of hardware components and devices.</p>
<p>Some hardware device drivers are in the OS, while some are in the <span><strong>Basic Input Output System</strong> (</span><strong>BIOS</strong>) and <span><strong>Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor</strong> (</span><strong>CMOS</strong>) and others are on the motherboard chipset. However, for the most part, device driver installation occurs either before or after the installation of the associated device on a computer. There are device software programs that assist the configuration of a device and the installation of the device driver.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The OS's communication with a device driver is a bit more involved than just passing data back and forth. <em>How does the device driver or the OS know that an action is need by either?</em> <em>How do they communicate to each other to say that a requested action is complete and if data is involved, where is it?</em></p>
<p>The most common answer to these questions involves <strong>system resources</strong>. A system resource is actually any addressable element of a computer. System resources are a portion of main memory (RAM) that is set aside for OS/device interactions. System resources can also be provided by the CPU, motherboard, chipset, and other system components. However, the system resources involved with device control and communication are those that are found in RAM.</p>
<p>There are four categories of system resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interrupt requests (IRQs)</strong>: In a classroom or a group meeting, if you wish to ask a question, you might raise your hand above your head and wait for recognition. An IRQ works essentially the same way—when a device or the OS needs the CPU to perform a task, it <em>raises its hand</em> by setting an assigned <em>IRQ on</em>. The CPU frequently checks the IRQs and if one is set to on, the CPU <em>interrupts</em> what it's doing to take care of the request, hence the name. After completing the task, the IRQ is set to <em>off</em>. The following screenshot shows the IRQs on a Windows system:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-986 image-border" src="Images/ad60a361-0857-4936-9303-415eadb33e48.jpg" style="width:31.92em;height:30.42em;" width="793" height="756"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The IRQ assignments of a Windows system</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>I/O addresses</strong>: Each installed I/O device on a computer has one or more addresses assigned to it. This address, which has several names, including I/O port, port address, or simply <em>port</em>, designates a device specifically and is not an address in memory. This address is like the street address on a house. The motherboard's address bus toggles between I/O addresses and memory addresses. When the bus is set to I/O addresses, the hardware device controllers monitor the bus for their individual addresses. If a device sees its I/O address, it responds to the request as appropriate. The following screenshot shows the I/O address assignments of a Windows system:</li>
</ul>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The I/O address assignments of a Windows system</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory addresses</strong>: Along with its I/O address, an I/O device may also be assigned a block of memory to use as a data buffer or as a scratchpad space. Not every device gets a memory address, and the space that is assigned is not all that large. As you can see in the following screenshot, some devices, both physical and logical, have more than one memory address assignment:</li>
</ul>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Memory address assignments of a Windows system</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct memory access (DMA) addresses</strong>: A DMA device is a computer I/O or storage device that is able to read and write data directly from or to main memory. DMA transfers don't involve the CPU, which can then take care of other tasks:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-989 image-border" src="Images/92fe3acc-8a82-4991-9196-9c7850dc0479.jpg" style="width:66.75em;height:46.25em;" width="801" height="555"/></p>

<p>The management of data files, whether on an internal storage device or a NAS or SAN, is a primary function of an OS. File management involves the creation, modification, transfer, and removal of data units that are stored as a complete block. In performing file management, an OS interfaces with hardware controllers, driver software, and perhaps a data management system, such as a DBMS.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The tasks performed by the file management functions of an OS include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating new data files and recording their placement on the storage medium</li>
<li>Providing for the modification of a data file and, if necessary, its relocation</li>
<li>Performing the removal of a data file and any references to it</li>

<p>The security provisions of an OS encompass the rules, functions, processes, and settings that the OS applies to implement and maintain the <strong>confidentiality, integrity, and availability</strong> (<strong>CIA</strong>) of its computer system. Organizational security policies must include the protection of the OS and its physical and environmental safety, including theft, damage, or destruction. However, the primary focus of OS security must be to enforce the rules and perform the tasks that prevent unauthorized intrusion or interference.</p>
<p>The security of an OS requires that certain activities are a part of normal operations, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing patch and update management</li>
<li>Applying antivirus and malware updates</li>
<li>Examining all network traffic, inbound or outbound, through a firewall and/or other security appliances</li>

<p>An operating system has three primary parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel</strong>: Modern operating systems are modular, meaning that most essential services, such as memory management, I/O handling, and CPU interactions, are in the module that loads at startup and remains in memory—the <strong>kernel</strong>. Other functions and utilities load to memory as needed. As shown in the following diagram, there are two types of OS kernels—<strong>monolithic</strong> and <strong>microkernel</strong>. A monolithic OS, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, includes the functions that are needed for the basic functions of the computer and user-initiated software. As you can see in the following diagram, a microkernel OS pushes support for user-initiated programs into the user space. At the present time, there are no microkernel systems being widely used:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-991 image-border" src="Images/4bcc5f0f-f33e-4431-af3f-1ba2305c3f1c.jpg" style="width:34.33em;height:20.58em;" width="764" height="458"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"> The two types of OS kernels</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shell</strong>: An OS shell is a program that the OS starts to provide a user interface, commonly as a CLI, as shown in the following screenshot. In UNIX/Linux systems, there are several shells, each with their own command set and functions, such as the <strong>Bourne-Again Shell</strong> (<strong>Bash</strong>), the C shell, and the Korn shell. On a Windows system, the GUI displayed on the desktop represents a shell. The Windows Command Prompt also represents a shell:</li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Commands entered at the command prompt of a Linux shell</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filesystem</strong>: When you create a file and store it on a hard disk, you assume that you'll be able to find in the future. A filesystem maintains the physical placement of a file or data block on a disk drive and keeps a cross-reference of the location and the filename in an index. Filesystems organize data storage in directories, folders, files, and objects. Commonly used filesystems are NTFS on Windows and ext3 and ext4 on Linux systems.</li>

<p>The configuration of a computer's hardware, software, and firmware specifies the parameters and settings for its functions and operations. The hardware configuration settings in a computer's BIOS or <strong>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</strong> (<strong>UEFI</strong>), OS, and support systems, define its startup, the installed devices, and several performance and operation parameters.</p>
<p>Not every program or application uses every hardware component available on a computer.  The hardware any program uses will depend on its function and purpose. If a program only accepts two numbers from the user, adds them together, and prints the result to a display device without storing the result, the requirements of the program and the actions of the user affected the hardware used. In this particular case, the hardware involved was as follows:</p>

<li><strong>HDD</strong>: The program loaded to RAM</li>
<li><strong>RAM</strong>: The program was assigned an allocated space and instructions were passed to the CPU</li>
<li><strong>CPU</strong>: The instructions were executed</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong>: The results were passed to the controller and displayed</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the OS was the catalyst that guided this sequence, but in doing so, the OS involved only the hardware required to complete the task. So, <em>how does the OS know what hardware it has at its disposal?</em> That's what the BIOS/UEFI stores in CMOS. This information provides the OS with a list of the hardware devices it can use, and also how and where it can access each.</p>

<p>A major part of the system startup of a computer, that is, its boot up, is loading the OS kernel into RAM so that the CPU can turn control over to the OS. To perform this process, the boot program must know where to look for the OS, which could be an HDD, a CD, a flash drive, or any bootable device. In the BIOS/UEFI settings, the sequence of devices that the boot process should look onto locate the <strong>master boot record</strong> (<strong>MBR</strong>) can be set. The boot utility will look at each of the devices in the order of priority and boot the computer from the first one it encounters with the boot information. The following screenshot shows a simple UEFI boot sequence list:</p>

<p>Since the beginning of computer time, we have classified computer instructions and components by where they reside or their general characteristics. The components that we can touch and feel are <em>hardware</em>. Those we can't actually touch, feel, or hold, but can change, we call <em>software</em>. However, in computer systems, there is a component we can't touch, feel, or change, especially in older systems. This component exists somewhere between hardware and software, and we call it <em>firmware</em>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>What we refer to as firmware today can be one of two general technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BIOS</strong>: A legacy technology that uses data and instructions that are permanently loaded (<em>burned</em>) into a semiconductor during manufacturing. These instructions initiate the BIOS to begin the startup process and load the bootloader to complete the boot process. This low-level form of firmware is a part of the motherboard as a <strong>read-only memory</strong> (<strong>ROM</strong>)/<strong>programmable read-only memory</strong> (<strong>PROM</strong>), <strong>one-time programmable</strong> (<strong>OTP</strong>), and <strong>programmable logic array</strong> (<strong>PLA</strong>) chips.</li>
<li><strong>UEFI</strong>: This newer technology is replacing most BIOS on computers, but performs essentially the same functions. In fact, UEFI relies on BIOS for the <strong>power-on self-test</strong> (<strong>POST</strong>) function and the configuration specifications (commonly referred to as CMOS). Virtually all computers produced after 2010 have UEFI, with some also including BIOS. The following screenshot shows <span class="packt_screen">System Information</span> with the BIOS/UEFI settings:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-995 image-border" src="Images/c85710a9-94c4-4625-9a07-2e9c629092e7.jpg" style="width:42.17em;height:12.25em;" width="800" height="233"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"> The BIOS/UEFI settings on the System Information dialog box</div>
<p>In spite of its <em>permanent</em> nature, the firmware on most computer systems is upgradeable. The exact procedure varies with the motherboard manufacturer, operating system, or the age of the system, but the following steps are generally the process that's used to update system firmware:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that you are actually installing a newer version of the UEFI/BIOS. On a Windows system, run <kbd>MSINFO32</kbd>. On a Linux system, if the <kbd>/sys/firmware/efi</kbd> directory exists, the system is using UEFI. If that directory doesn't exist, the system is using BIOS. Record the version number and date and compare it to the information on the motherboard manufacturer's website.</li>
<li>Boot the computer and when the display informs you of which key to press to access the UEFI/BIOS settings, press it. Some systems include a firmware update function in the UEFI/BIOS utility.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>If no update utility is available, download and decompress the update file and store it on a USB flash drive or external disk drive.</li>
<li>Restart the system and access the firmware update or flashing utility on the UEFI/BIOS settings page. Back up the existing firmware to an external drive, just in case something goes wrong in the update.</li>
<li>Using the firmware update utility, select the newer version image and start the update. The upgrade should only take a few minutes, but, in any case, absolutely don't restart, shut down, or power off the computer until the upgrade process completes.</li>
</ol>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Preparing a disk for the OS</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are two approaches to installing a new version of your existing OS or replacing it with another OS altogether. If you are staying with the same OS and just installing a newer version, such as upgrading Windows 10 to Windows Whatever, you have the choice of performing an update, or what's called a <strong>clean install</strong>. Essentially, a clean install removes any obsolete or out-of-date elements of the old version and replaces them with the newer versions. A clean install can also mean that the HDD is new and that the installation is on a <em>clean</em> disk drive. An upgrade from one version to another means that a clean install isn't necessary and that the installation will use an installer or setup program from the publisher. On the other hand, if you are replacing one OS with another, such as replacing Windows with Linux, there are things you should know about and a few steps you should take before installing the new OS.</p>
<p>The method that's used to prepare an HDD depends on the system configuration and boot process in use. BIOS creates a MBR and UEFI creates a <strong>GUID partition table</strong> (<strong>GPT</strong>). An MBR creates legacy BIOS partition tables and a GPT creates UEFI partition tables. GUID is a Microsoft term for <strong>Globally Unique Identifier</strong> and is applicable only to its systems. The remainder of the OS world uses the term <strong>Universally Unique Identifier</strong> (<span><strong>UUID</strong>)</span><span> </span>for essentially the same structures. A GPT (UEFI) system is able to define and create more than four partitions on an HDD and is a must if the disk drive is 4 TB or more. Below those thresholds, the MBR (BIOS) system will work, if present. The following screenshot shows the partition table type for a Windows system HDD:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-996 image-border" src="Images/c36018bf-7baf-4652-bc2d-240341e5b943.jpg" style="width:44.42em;height:44.17em;" width="800" height="795"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The Properties dialog box showing the partition style of an HDD</div>
<p>The following steps are for the general process of preparing a disk for the installation of an OS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that the computer on which the installation will occur meets or exceeds the system requirements published by the OS publisher.</li>
<li>If the HDD has data on it that you wish to preserve, take a total system backup to an external medium, such as an external HDD or a cloud service.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>If you wish to remove all previous data and content from the HDD on a Windows system, use the <span class="packt_screen">Disk Management</span> format option. On a Linux system, use the <kbd>fdisk</kbd> command.</li>
<li>Create the disk partitions needed for the installation using either the <span class="packt_screen">Disk Management</span> utility or the <kbd>DISKPART.EXE</kbd> command at the Windows Command Prompt. The following screenshot shows an example of the <kbd>DISKPART</kbd> commands. The <kbd>fdisk</kbd> command is used on a Linux system.</li>
<li>After creating the partitions, format them to the appropriate partition table standard:</li>

<p>When you store data on an HDD, USB-connected storage, or any other data storage device, it needs to have an organizational scheme so that individual files can be located in the future. A filesystem organizes and structures a storage medium and tracks the files stored on it. Along with location, a filesystem also catalogs identifying data for each file, including filename, size, status, creation and modification dates, access permissions, ownership, file type, and more.</p>

<p>The placement of a filesystem on a data storage device, which may have several partitions or just one big one, happens through the process of formatting. Each partition may have a different filesystem. Formatting a drive generally does three things: recognizes a partition as a bounded structure; removes (erases) all existing data and indexing, if any, from the partition; and initiates a filesystem and its indexing in the partition. Each of the major operating systems has a utility to format a disk drive partition: <strong>Windows Disk Management</strong>, <strong>Linux's GParted</strong>, and <strong>Mac OS Disk Utility</strong>.</p>

<p>In the Server+ exam, you will encounter questions and references about filesystems of Windows, Linux, and macOS. The filesystems that are included are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>File Allocation Table 32 (FAT32)</strong>: At one time, this was the default standard for Windows systems. It was used primarily for the format of flash memory drives.</li>
<li><strong>New Technology Filesystem (NTFS)</strong>: The default filesystem for Windows systems. The Windows system partition must be NTFS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Linux/Unix:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better Filesystem (Btrfs)</strong>: Adds pooling, snapshots, checksums, and other features to Linux.</li>
<li><strong>Extended Filesystem versions 2, 3, and 4 (ext2, ext3, and ext4)</strong>: A filesystem based on the <strong>Unix Filesystem</strong> (<strong>UFS</strong>) that tracks individual files.</li>
<li><strong>Reiser Filesystem (ReiserFS)</strong>: A journaling filesystem for Linux.</li>
<li><strong>Z File System (ZFS)</strong>: Originally developed for the Solaris OS, it is common for Linux systems to support NAS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mac OS:</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple File System (APFS)</strong>: Replaces the HFS+ operating system on later Mac OS X systems.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical File System Plus (HFS+)</strong>: The de facto standard filesystem of older Mac OS systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are filesystems that perform journaling and some that don't, though most of those are legacy filesystems. A journaling filesystem records filesystem changes before applying them to the medium of a <em>journal</em>, which is essentially a filesystem activity log. Typically, a journal is on a separate device to the filesystem. The journal file provides recovery data should the filesystem be damaged. Examples of journaling filesystems are NTFS, ReiserFS, ext3, and ext4.</p>

<p>Sometimes, a filesystem really isn't a filesystem, but may perform some filesystem functions. The <strong>Virtual Machine File System</strong> (<strong>VMFS</strong>) works with a virtualized system's hypervisor to store and manage virtual machine snapshots and images. Swap, also known as <strong>swap space</strong>, is a space in a dedicated partition of a secondary storage device that the OS uses to store inactive memory pages to free up memory resources, as needed. The <strong>Flash-Friendly File System</strong> (<strong>F2FS</strong>) is an open source flash drive filesystem.</p>

<p>On a Linux server, there are two hostnames to configure: a network-related hostname and a local hostname. The steps used to set the hostnames are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log on to the system as the root administrator (the superuser).</li>
<li>Move to the <kbd>/etc/sysconfig</kbd> directory to locate the network file and display its contents, which should look something like the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong># cat network</strong><br/><strong>NETWORKING=yes</strong><br/><strong>NETWORKING_IPV6=no</strong><br/><strong>HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <kbd>cat</kbd> command displays the contents of the file network. Notice that the last line of the file contains the hostname setting.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use a Linux editor (vi or edit) to change the <kbd>HOSTNAME</kbd> value to the hostname you wish to use. After you've completed the edit, save the file.</li>
<li>The edited file should now contain the revised hostname value. For example, the network file may now contain something like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong># cat network</strong><br/><strong>NETWORKING=yes</strong><br/><strong>NETWORKING_IPV6=no</strong><br/><strong>HOSTNAME=server+os1</strong></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>The hostname in the <kbd>localhosts</kbd> file also needs to be set. Move to the <kbd>/etc</kbd> directory to find the <kbd>hosts</kbd> file. Its contents should be along the lines of the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong># cat hosts</strong><br/><strong>127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost</strong><br/><strong>::1 localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6</strong></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Using an editor, replace the <kbd>localhost.localdomain localhost</kbd> value with the new hostname and save the file. After the change, the hosts file should contain something like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong># cat hosts</strong><br/><strong>127.0.0.1 server+os1</strong><br/><strong>::1 localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6</strong></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>You may want to also set the Terminal identity to the hostname of the server. The local network uses the Terminal name to address the server. To change the Terminal's hostname, use the <kbd>hostname</kbd> command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong># hostname server+os1</strong></pre>
<p>To verify the change, use the <kbd>hostname</kbd> command with no parameters.</p>

<p>On a Windows Server system, a user may have one or two account types: a local account or a domain user account. A <strong>local user account</strong> limits the user to only the resources for which file and folder permissions grant access to the individual or to any group the individual is a member on a single network node. A <strong>domain user account</strong> can access either local or network (or both) resources, according to the access permissions assigned to the individual or to the groups the individual is a member of.</p>

<p>The creation of a domain user account assumes that at least one domain exists on a network. In the Windows world, a <strong>domain</strong> is a network where a database on a central domain controller contains information on all domain user accounts, security configuration, and the hardware devices on the network. The network's <strong>Active Directory</strong> (<strong>AD</strong>) service manages domain user accounts. To create a new domain user account on a Windows Server system, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Start menu, open <strong><span class="packt_screen">Server Manager</span></strong> and pull down the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> menu.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> menu, select the <span class="packt_screen">Active Directory Users and Computer</span> option to display its dialog box.</li>
<li>In the left-hand navigation pane, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Users</span> folder. On the option list that appears, click on <span class="packt_screen">New.</span> On its option list, click on <span class="packt_screen">User</span> to display the <span class="packt_screen">New Object - User</span> dialog box, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p>To communicate on any network, a PC must join the network, which means that the network interface in the PC must connect to and join a network server's administrative systems. On a Windows system, the PC joins a domain. The process to add a PC to a domain is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Control Panel</span>, click on the <span class="packt_screen">System</span> option and choose <span class="packt_screen">About</span> from the options in the left-hand side pane.</li>
<li>Clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Join a domain</span> button opens the first of the domain identification dialog boxes. </li>
<li>You will see three or four <span class="packt_screen">Join a domain</span> dialog boxes in the next step. The first dialog box, as shown in the following screenshot, asks you for the name of the domain to which you wish to add the PC. If the domain name is valid, enter the username and password that you (personally) use to log on to the domain. While the system is authenticating the information you've entered, a blank copy of the first screen may be displayed:</li>

<p>It's one thing to add a PC to a network domain and quite another to actually connect a PC to the network for active communication. Once a PC is in a domain, the next step is to verify that the electronics all synchronize and interoperate. In other words, <em>can the PC talk to the network?</em></p>
<p>Of course, the medium used to communicate over a network does have an impact on the setup of network communications, as you might expect. However, you'd be surprised at how little of a difference this actually makes. Both physical cable and <strong>radio frequency</strong> (<strong>RF</strong>) communications are predominantly Ethernet networks.</p>

<p>To ensure that a PC will connect to a network, there are a few steps to verify that the necessary elements are active before testing its communications. The first element to check is its connection service. A cable-connected network needs the <span class="packt_screen">Wired AutoConfig</span> service's startup type, as shown in the following screenshot, set to automatic. If the workstation is connecting to a wireless local network, the <span class="packt_screen">WLAN AutoConfig</span> service is set, or if the workstation is connecting to a wireless wide area network, configure the <span class="packt_screen">WWAN AutoConfig</span> service. Whichever one of these three network services is activated, the other two should be deactivated:</p>

<p>A server role is one or more programs or sets of utilities that a server can use to provide a specific feature or function to a user, group of computers, or an application. Server roles and features set the purpose or role of a server.

<p>Network administrators often need to access a remote computer for a variety of reasons. One of the more common tasks facing network administrators is the upgrade of software, including the OS, or running diagnostic utilities. In the past, these tasks required what the communication industry calls <em>a truck roll</em>, or a physical visit to the remote location. If remote means only across the building, there isn't usually too much of a problem. However, if remote means in another state, country, or continent, the time and cost required to affect changes can really grow. A number of different standards, software, and technologies are available to allow the network administrator to make these changes without the need to travel any further than from his or her desk to a network workstation.</p>
<p>The first of these tools is Intel's <strong>Wired for Management</strong> (<strong>WfM</strong>) specification, which allows a network administrator to create an automatic procedure to accomplish client maintenance and management over a network. You can also work with other tools, such as the <strong>LANDesk Client Manager</strong> (<strong>LDCM</strong>), a software tool that monitors network clients for hardware issues, and the <strong>Desktop Management Interface</strong> (<strong>DMI</strong>), which is an <strong>application programming interface</strong> (<strong>API</strong>) that allows software to inventory a network client, such as the details of which motherboard, expansion bus cards, and application software it has.</p>
<p>Another tool that WfM works with is the <strong>Preboot Execution Environment</strong> (<strong>PXE</strong>), pronounced <em>pixi</em>. PXE enables a network administrator to boot a network client from a server by interfacing only with the client's PXE-enabled <strong>network interface card</strong> (<strong>NIC</strong>) or network adapter. PXE clients connect through their NICs to a network, even when the PC's power is off. The PXE client need not have an operating system, nor any other software for this remote boot to take place, even if it's on the client. The network administrator can then use a tool such as <strong>Trivial File Transport Protocol</strong> (<strong>TFTP</strong>) to transfer software or data to the client.</p>
<p>Windows systems and Linux systems, for the most part, provide a PXE <strong>network boot program</strong> (<strong>NBP</strong>). Windows systems provide the <strong>Remote Installation Service</strong> (<strong>RIS</strong>), which incorporates the PXE standard. Linux systems support the <strong>PXELINUX</strong> and the <strong>gPXE</strong> utilities.</p>

<p>Network users expect the network to meet their individual needs in terms of bandwidth, speed, and responsiveness. These three expectations are parts of the same whole to the user—a network that performs consistently to provide the service that's expected. A network administrator can use a variety of processes, techniques, and methods to promote efficiency and effectiveness on a network at any level.</p>
<p>Some of the ways that the network administrator can ensure a network always meets its users' needs include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: Network administrators fully understand that a 10 Gbps network doesn't mean that users, individually or collectively, will realize that much bandwidth. Every network must consider the bandwidth loss from just providing a working network. To users, the network administrator's primary job is to keep bandwidth high for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>High availability and fault tolerance</strong>: As we discussed earlier in this chapter, HA and fault tolerance can be the key characteristics of a network that users depend upon. How much of the 525,600 minutes of uptime possible in a year a system is designed to achieve is an important design goal.</li>
<li><strong>Load balancing</strong>: On larger networks and data centers in which servers are clustered or distributed, load balancing can accept multiple input sources and distribute them to multiple processors, evening out the processing of the load and the outbound traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Service (QoS)</strong>: Although its name reflects how users measure a network's performance, QoS is the ability of a network to provide a variety of services over a variety of communication methods at a level that meets the needs of the organization. A network that supports data, voice, and video consistently has QoS.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>An NOS provides system control and management functions to network clients and resources and provide</span> administration, security, resources, and other services to network clients. An OS has five primary functions: user/computer communications, memory management; control and coordinate hardware; internal and network file management; and user, data, application, and resource security. There are four categories of system resources; IRQs, I/O addresses, memory addresses, and <strong>direct memory access</strong> (<strong>DMA</strong>) addresses.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The file management functions of an OS include creating new files, providing for file modification, performing file removal, organizing files for accessibility, and facilitating access for multiple users. The security of an OS requires patch and update management, antivirus and malware updates, the examination of all traffic by a security appliance, and the regular review of user and group account permissions and rights. An operating system has three primary parts: the kernel, the shell, and the filesystem. <span>A filesystem organizes a storage medium and tracks the files stored on it. It also catalogs identifying file data for each file. </span><span>Formatting a drive recognizes a partition as a bounded structure, removes existing data and indexing, and initiates a filesystem and its indexing in the partition. </span></p>
<p>The hardware configuration settings in BIOS or UEFI, OS, and support systems, define startup, installed devices, and performance and operation parameters. Firmware is one of two general technologies: BIOS and UEFI. WfM allows an automatic procedure to do client maintenance and management over a network. DMI allows software to make an inventory of the hardware and software of a network client. PXE enables a network administrator to boot a network client remotely. TFTP transfers software or data to a remote client.</p>
