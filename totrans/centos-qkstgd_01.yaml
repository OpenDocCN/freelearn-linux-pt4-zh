    a fast, stable, and open source enterprise-grade Linux distribution used on laptops,
    desktops, and servers. It is derived from the source code of **Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux** (**RHEL**), which is developed and maintained by the CentOS community.
    All proprietary content related to Red Hat Inc. is removed from the CentOS packages,
    which are then recompiled with CentOS community assets, such as logos and so on.
    CentOS 7 is an exact replica of RHEL 7, but is available for free with community
    support and updates. The CentOS project is now officially sponsored by Red Hat
    Inc. and is most suitable for environments where commercial support for operating
    systems is not mandatory.'

    CentOS 7.6-1810, where 7.6 comes from RHEL 7.6 and 1810 shows its release date
    (October 2018). CentOS 7.6 can be installed on physical or virtual hardware. You
    can use any of the main desktop virtualization software utilities, such as Oracle
    VirtualBox ([https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
    or VMWare Workstation ([https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)),
    as per your environment. My choice for desktop virtualization software is VirtualBox
    as it is free, open-source, and easy to use. You will also need a working internet
    connection to download the CentOS image from the community download page.

    physical console supports multiple virtual consoles, which act as separate Terminals

    console is the GUI in CentOS/RHEL. In addition to the first graphical environment,
    five pure text-based environments are also available on a virtual console with
    which you can access a login shell. *Ctrl* + *Alt* + (*F2* through *F6*) are text-based
