<p>In this chapter, we'll review standard troubleshooting methods and procedures and common server issues that are caused by hardware, software, network, storage devices, and security systems.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will review the general procedures and methods for identifying, isolating, recreating, applying, and testing a failure or fault in any general hardware, software, network, storage device, and security policies and devices. The following five chapters in this part of this book cover the specific troubleshooting processes for each of these subsystems, respectively. The topics in this chapter are a review of the troubleshooting procedures that apply to any troubleshooting situation, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Troubleshooting steps</li>
<li>Identifying the problem</li>
<li>Establishing and testing a theory of cause</li>
<li>Developing a plan of action to resolve a problem</li>
<li>Documenting findings and outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p>Troubleshooting, in the context of computers, servers, and networking, is a structured process that's used to identify, isolate, and resolve a performance issue or a malfunctioning component. Regardless of the size, purpose, use, or location of the computer, its problems are important to its users, operators, and stakeholders. The computer repair technician's responsibilities are simple, actually—identify the problem, resolve the problem, and document both actions. Yes, there are a few more steps to this process, but they're mostly to verify assumptions and test the solution.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>While there's no real standard for the steps that are using in a troubleshooting process, the troubleshooting steps that are detailed in the Server+ exam's objectives are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the problem and determine the scope</li>
<li>Establish a theory of probable cause</li>
<li>Test the theory to determine cause</li>
<li>Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and notify impacted users</li>
<li>Implement the solution or escalate as appropriate</li>
<li>Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures</li>
<li>Document findings, actions, and outcomes throughout the process</li>
</ol>
<p>Understand that the application of these steps may or may not be necessary in every troubleshooting situation. For example, the failure of a common component is easy to identify, replace, test, and document. In other less obvious instances, each troubleshooting step is necessary and important.</p>
<p>The technician's knowledge of computer systems is an important tool for troubleshooting a computer problem. However, the technician's interpersonal skills can be as important, if not more important. The ability to interact with a frustrated or flustered end user, a supervisor, or a general stakeholder to learn more about the nature of the problem is an essential skill for a computer repair technician. In addition, the technician's work habits and ethics are on display throughout the troubleshooting and repair process. The work that's performed should be efficient, effective, and correct.</p>

<p>Identifying the actual cause of a problem is the first step of a troubleshooting process. However, the first step of that first step should be verifying that there's a problem. Commonly, problems occur not long, if not immediately, after changes are made to the hardware or software. Or the user or stakeholder thinks that something happened, but can't recreate what they think they saw, heard, or smelled. To verify that a problem is real, recreate it—if possible—or take the time to question the user with open questions (ones that cannot have just yes or no as answers). Remember that a user, supervisor, or stakeholders don't usually have your knowledge or understanding of computer systems.</p>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>After you're sure that there is a problem, regardless of whether it's the one reported or another cause altogether, start the process of identifying the source, cause, and location of the problem. Most PC hardware problems are relatively obvious, but what can appear to be a hardware problem could very well be a software issue. Or the symptoms may relate to problems that are possible on several components, or one problem is showing up as several different problems.</p>
<p>Regardless of the source of a problem, if possible, you should back up the hard disk and document an inventory of the installed components, if for no other reason than you will be able to restore a problem-free system back to where you started.</p>

<p>While this may seem like a simple question, some problems may be difficult to pin down based only on its symptoms. The troubleshooting approach and possibly the tools you use are different for these two areas. If you clearly can't make a decision on the source of the problem, draw on your knowledge and experience to begin troubleshooting what you believe is the issue.</p>

<p>To determine whether a reported problem is a hardware issue or what appears to be a software issue that's really a hardware issue (for example, the <strong>Blue Screen of Death</strong> (<span><strong>BSoD</strong>)</span>), a systematic approach is best. In fact, hardware issues are often related to loose connectors or jumpers, dirty fans and components, or a hardware component malfunctioning due to a software error. When troubleshooting a hardware issue, take care of any obvious issues first, regardless of whether you believe they have anything to do with the issue. A PC that isn't clean is much easier to work with when it's clean; dust can conduct electricity.</p>
<p>Common areas of hardware issues include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main memory</li>
<li>Power supply</li>
<li>Cooling fan</li>
<li>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</li>
<li>Video or graphics cards</li>
<li>Expansion cards, slots, and ports</li>
<li>Cable connections</li>

<p>Software problems are much more frequent than issues with hardware components. The software on a computer is one of three general types: system software (for example, an operating system), application software (for example, LibreOffice), and utility software (for example, device drivers). Each software type can have its own set of problems. Operating system problems are typically the result of improper or erroneous configuration, settings, or compatibility issues. An operating system problem may require a minor adjustment or a complete re-installation. Application software issues may have some of the same problems, but generally a serious problem can be resolved through an update, patch, or correcting the registry. Utility software issues are primarily version issues and can be easily solved with a replacement installation.</p>
<p>Some causes of common software issues are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing or corrupted system or configuration files</li>
<li>Malware attacks</li>
<li>Improperly installed or removed software</li>
<li>Corrupted filesystems or registries</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>Identifying a problem is one thing, often obvious, but sometimes identifying the underlying cause can be more problematic. Establishing a probable cause is a process that identifies the possible causes of a problem, analyzes their probability of being a cause, and, in the end, identifying one or more causes to investigate further. The overall objective of this process is to identify the probable root causes of the problem. List the probable causes with the simpler or more obvious issues at the top and the more complex and less likely at the bottom.</p>
<p>Working from the prioritized list, top to bottom, begin testing each one to either prove or disprove the probable causes you identified. The possible causes at the top of the list should be the simplest to test. If one of the probabilities proves to be the cause of the problem, the next step is to develop a plan to resolve the issue. However, if after testing each of the probable causes in the list of possibilities none proved to be the exact cause of the problem, you should reconsider the problem and, if possible, develop another list of probable causes. If you exhaust all possible probable causes—at least the ones you can come up with—it may be necessary to escalate the investigation to a more skilled technician or perhaps the manufacturer.</p>

<p>In a vast majority of cases, the plan to resolve the problem is simply one of removing a hardware component, applying a patch to an application, or resetting or re-configuring system settings or parameters. The basic process that's involved is to acquire the replacement part or software (if the resolution requires the replacement of a hardware component), make the workspace free of static electricity to prevent electrostatic damage to the internal components, gather the appropriate tools, make the required fix, and thoroughly test the revised system completely.</p>
<p>If you're resolving more than one issue, affect the repair and test each one separately. As you proceed, each subsequent test step retests each of the earlier fixes, so you want to consider the sequence of your work to be accumulatively compatible. If, after making the change or one of a series of changes, the problem remains or a new problem appears, you should reverse the changes that were made to that point and reconsider your solution. After completing the repair and successfully testing it, notify its user or stakeholder and brief him or her on the cause of the problem, how you identified the cause, what you did to resolve the problem, and how you tested the solution.</p>

<p>At this point, you've tested the repair or resolution that was made to alleviate the problem and it's time to fully test the functionality of the full system and, if appropriate, the interaction of the system with any devices with which it interacts. Preferably, the assigned user, a supervisor, or a knowledgeable stakeholder should do this testing. Should this test fail at any level, document the point of failure and restart the entire troubleshooting process, focusing on the new failure.</p>
<p>If the testing is successful and the system functions as it should, determine whether there are any possible preventive measures that could help to avoid the same or similar failures in the future. These preventive measures may be as simple as improvements to the backup procedures or adjusting the <span><strong>Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning</strong> (</span><strong>HVAC</strong>) system, or as severe as planning to replace the entire system as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Beginning with the initial installation of a network server or host, comprehensive documentation should be as much a part of a system as any of its hardware and software. The documentation of individual computers and network and system-attached devices should record its repair and maintenance history. This record must detail any troubleshooting activities, successful or not, any repairs, upgrades, patches, fixes, additions to, and even removals from, each system. Its importance as a repair and maintenance record comes from the fact that, typically, only one technician performs nearly all computer or system troubleshooting, repair, and maintenance actions.</p>
<p>Complete documentation of the troubleshooting, repairs, and maintenance is more important to the next technician who is going to be working on the system than it may be to you or anyone else. Since the document contains a written record of any reported problems and their resolution, it reduces any guesswork for future technicians. The information that a complete documentation of repair and maintenance actions should include the date, location, and contact at the trouble site; the reported problem/reason for the technician's visit; a description of the troubleshooting performed; a description of the repair made and the identity of any components that were replaced, added, or removed; a description or the identity of any software changes, including updates, configurations, installation, or removals; a detailed description of the testing performed and the results from each test; and any suspected issues not covered in this visit or potential maintenance or repair issues for later attention.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting is a structured process that's used to identify, isolate, and resolve a performance issue or a malfunctioning component. The troubleshooting steps in the Server+ objectives are first, identify the problem and its effects; identify one or more probable causes for the problem; choose the most likely cause of the problem and verify it as the cause; plan out the steps needed to solve the problem; explain the steps to be taken to any effected users; perform the resolution plan; test the corrections and the whole system; and, of course, document every step of this process and your actions. Knowledge of computer systems is important for troubleshooting, but interpersonal skills are just as important. A technician's good work habits and ethics, as well as his or her work should be efficient, effective, and correct.</p>
<p>Identifying the cause of a problem is the first step of troubleshooting, and the first step of that first step is to verify that there's a problem. Frequently, problems show up after changes to hardware or software. The user reports a problem but cannot recreate it. You can verify a problem by recreating it. Most PC hardware problems are obvious. However, what may appear to be a hardware problem may be a software issue. Back up the hard disk and document the installed components.</p>
<p>Common areas of hardware problems include main memory (RAM); power supply; cooling fans; hard disk drive; video or graphics cards; expansion cards, slots, and ports; and cables and connections. Computer software is system software, application software, and utility software. Common software issues include missing or corrupted system or configuration files; malware attacks; improperly installed software; and corrupted filesystems or registry entries.</p>
<p>Establishing a probable cause identifies the possible causes of a problem and their probability. Work from a prioritized list and test each possibility identified. Resolve the problem and test the revised system completely. Fully test the full system and involve the user. Documentation should include a complete record of the troubleshooting and work that was performed.</p>
